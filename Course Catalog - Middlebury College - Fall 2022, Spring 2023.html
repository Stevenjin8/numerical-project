		<h1>Program in American Studies</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>Requirements for the Major</h2>
<p>A minimum of eleven courses including AMST 0209, AMST 0210, AMST 0400, three AMST electives, four courses in a concentration designed in consultation with a faculty advisor, and AMST 0701 or one additional elective numbered 0200 or higher.   </p>
<h3>Electives</h3>
<p>Three AMST electives, two of which must be numbered 0200 or higher.  These courses must be listed or cross-listed as AMST courses in the course catalog.  Courses may not count toward both the elective and concentration requirements.</p>
<h3>Junior Seminar (AMST 0400)</h3>
<p>Students should normally take this seminar in the Fall of their Junior year.  Where compelling circumstances make doing this impossible, arrangements to take the course as a senior may be made with the director of the American Studies program.</p>
<h3>Senior Project (AMST 0701)</h3>
<p>AMST majors may enroll in AMST 0701, where they will complete a substantial research project in consultation with an AMST faculty adviser. Research projects are subject to approval by the AMST faculty, who will pair each approved project with an appropriate faculty adviser. Students who envision an AMST 701 project requiring collaboration must be granted departmental approval.  Normally, AMST senior projects will be completed in one semester. The senior project may take the form of a formal written document, a multi-media project such as a video, a web project, a creative activity such as a performance, or an installation project. An oral defense is part of senior work. Senior work is one of the requirements for departmental honors (see Honors section of AMST major requirements).</p>
<h2>Honors</h2>
<p>Honors will be based on a student’s cumulative AMST record and the quality of their AMST 0701 project.</p>
<h2>Concentrations</h2>
<p>Concentrations must bring together coherent clusters of four courses that address particular themes, periods, movements, or modes of thought and expression. In consultation with an advisor and with approval of the program, students will develop an interdisciplinary concentration in one of these areas: </p>
<h3>Popular Culture</h3>
<p>Students will study popular cultural forms, their reception, and the history of their production in the United States.  Courses will especially focus on the conflicts between popular culture as a site of creativity and democratic empowerment on the one hand, and as a product of dominant commercialized cultural industries on the other.</p>
<h3>Race and Ethnicity</h3>
<p>Students will examine specific groups in depth and in comparison, exploring racial and ethnic history, political struggles, creative and cultural practices, and individual and collective modes of identity formation.  By studying how and why racial and ethnic identities have evolved in the United States, students will understand their central place in the formation of the American nation.</p>
<h3>Artistic and Intellectual Traditions</h3>
<p>Students will focus on literary, religious, philosophical, and social thought and its expression in the United States.  They will be encouraged to examine particular currents of thought (e. g. evangelicalism, liberalism, romanticism, modernism, progressivism) or modes of expression (e.g. literature, visual art, or film) that have been important to American culture. </p>
<h3>Space and Place</h3>
<p>Students will explore the importance of landscape and place in American culture.  Course work may include the study of American regional geography, the historical and aesthetic dimensions of the built environment, the impacts of urban growth, suburbanization, or the imagining of utopian spaces. </p>
<h3>Cultural Politics</h3>
<p>Students will explore the relationship between culture, ideology, and the political system.  People create meaning about their personal and public lives through cultural practices, but those practices take place within institutional and ideological structures.  Relevant courses might explore ethics and religion; political parties and social movements; feminism and gender studies; and representation and visual culture.</p>
<h3>Self-Designed Concentration</h3>
<p>Self-designed concentrations must be built in close consultation with a faculty advisor and should focus on a cultural theme or interdisciplinary area of inquiry.  Potential topics might include: Gender &amp; American Culture; American Environmentalism; Visual Culture; Industrialization of America; and Immigration and Cultural Exchanges.</p>
<h2>Joint Major Requirements</h2>
<p>Students may major in AMST jointly with another discipline or program. Students must discuss their rationale for doing so with their advisor in AMST and joint majors must be approved by the faculty in AMST. Required courses for a joint major in AMST are: AMST 0209, AMST 0210, AMST 0400, and 3 AMST electives.</p>
<h2>Minor Requirements</h2>
<p>Students may complete a minor in American Studies by taking the following courses: AMST 0210, AMST 0209, AMST 0400, three AMST electives.</p>
<h2>Study Abroad</h2>
<p>The faculty members of the Program in American Studies recognize the benefits of cross-cultural learning and encourage majors to take advantage of study abroad opportunities. Often students returning from study abroad undertake senior work that responds to their cultural learning while abroad. We encourage students to take courses in their study abroad program that focus on the host culture and thereby allow the best opportunity for cultural comparison.</p>
<p>American Studies majors normally take AMST 0400, a required seminar, in the fall semester of their junior year. Under compelling circumstances that leave only the fall available as an option for study abroad, majors may be able to take AMST 0400 in the fall semester of their senior year. Such arrangements must be discussed in advance with, and approved by, the director of the American Studies program. The American Studies program enjoys being host to exchange students from the American studies programs at the Universities of East Anglia and Nottingham in Great Britain.</p>

			<h3>AMST 0101 American Holidays (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will offer an introduction to the interdisciplinary study of American culture and identity. Integrating a range of sources and methods, we will examine myths, symbols, values, and social changes that have been used to create and contest ideas of "Americanness." This year we will focus on holidays, both secular and religious, and how they have been celebrated or observed in the U.S., past and present, privately and publicly. With a multifaith and multiethnic scope, we will consider holidays such as Easter, Purim, Passover, Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr, Yom Kippur, and Diwali, as well as largely-secular holidays such as Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, Halloween, and Thanksgiving. We will also compare and contrast a variety of New Year festivities as they are celebrated by immigrant and diasporic communities. Sources for the course will include greeting cards, advertisements, magazine illustrations, decorations, cookbooks and recipes, genre paintings, music, photographic documentation of parades and festivals, and objects related to the celebration and observation of religious holidays from a variety of faiths and traditions. 3 hrs.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>AMST 0104 Television and American Culture (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">This course explores American life in the last seven decades through an analysis of our central medium: television. Spanning a history of television from its origins in radio to today’s digital convergence via YouTube and Netflix, we will consider television's role in both representing and constituting American society through a variety of approaches, including: the economics of the television industry, television's role within American democracy, the formal attributes of various television genres, television as a site of gender and racial identity formation, television's role in everyday life, the medium's technological transformations, and television as a site of global cultural exchange. 3 hrs. lect./disc. / 3 hrs. screen</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>AMST 0108 Childhood in America (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will explore “childhood” as an evolving social and cultural construct.  Beginning by acknowledging great diversity in the lived experience of childhood (shaped by race, gender, geography, religion, ability/disability), we will examine representations of childhood and experiences of children from the early nineteenth century to the present.  Together we will explore classic works of literature such as Alcott’s <em>Little Women</em>, Twain’s <em>Huck Finn</em>, and Morrison’s <em>The Bluest Eye</em>, in conversation with historical documents and visual and material artifacts (illustrations, painting, toys, and films).  Throughout, we will consider how understanding conceptions of childhood illuminate American social and cultural history more broadly. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>AMST 0109 U.S. Origin Stories (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Some U.S. origin stories cast (white) Americans as chosen people, discoverers of a bountiful continent, their community a beacon of righteousness to the world. Other stories locate the nation's origins in slavery or in settler colonialism. One story celebrates America’s founding commitment to freedom, equality, and justice - principles which, in turn, sustain another origin story – that of America as a nation borne of and welcoming to immigrants. Origin stories might be foundational, but their meanings are never fixed. In this course we will explore the elasticity and persistence of origin stories, evident in current debates about whether U.S. history begins in 1619 or 1776, about migrant rights, about the self-determination of indigenous peoples, about white nationalism, and about U.S. global leadership. 3 hrs. lect./disc. <strong>This course is part of the Public Humanities Labs Initiative administered by the Axinn Center for the Humanities.*</strong></span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will trace American immigration history from the late 19th to the turn of the 21st century, and examine the essential place immigration has occupied in the making of modern America and American culture. The central themes of this course will be industrialization and labor migrations, aftermaths of wars and refugees, constructions of racial categories and ethnic community identities, legal defining of "aliens" and citizenship, and diversity in immigrant experiences. To explore these themes, we will engage a range of sources including memoirs, novels, oral histories, and films.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>AMST 0180 Critical Studies of Sport (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Sports offer important contexts for the study of social relations, inequalities, and differences in North America. Sports exist as an important arena where ideas around class, gender, sexuality, race, ability, and status are embodied and performed. In this course we will discuss the significance of sports to ideas of the self as well as in broader cultural, social, economic, and political realms. We will analyze a variety of issues including the relationship of sports to media, celebrity, money, religion, and education. We will also investigate the significance of sports and athletes to contemporary processes of globalization.

We will examine issues pertaining to gender identification, violence, and hero worship. Reading critical essays on the subject, studying media coverage of sporting events, and writing short analytical essays will enable us to determine key elements concerning how sports are contextualized in American culture. Student essays will form the basis of a more in-depth inquiry that each student will then present, using media, at the end of the course.

			<h3>AMST 0234 American Consumer Culture (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">For many Americans in the 20th century, consumer goods came to embody the promise of the "good life."  Yet mass consumption also fostered economic, political, and social inequalities and engendered anti-consumerist activism. In this course we will pursue an interdisciplinary approach to American consumer culture, focusing on the rise of commercialized leisure and advertising; the role of radio, television, and film in shaping consumer practices; and the relationship of consumerism to social inequality and democratic citizenship. Readings will include works by Veblen, Marcuse, Bordieu, Marchand, Cohen, and Schor.  3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>AMST 0239 The Cultural Work of Country Music (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">“I like all kinds of music...except country.”  Arguably, aversion to American country music often tracks with class- and race-based assumptions about both makers and consumers of this genre.  In this course we will challenge those views while studying the history of the form.  Balancing our consideration of the big picture with case studies of performers like Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, and The Chicks, we will explore what types of music the “country” tag comprises; some of the major themes and motifs associated with the form; the Black and White roots of country music; and the politicization of the music and its performers throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.  Source materials for the course will include Bill Malone’s <em>Country Music, USA</em>; Ken Burn’s <em>Country Music</em> documentary; <em>Creating Country Music: Fabricating Authenticity</em>, and <em>A Good-Natured Riot: The Birth of the Grand Ole Opry</em>.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>AMST 0251 Constructing Memory: American Monuments and Memorials (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">“Democracy has no monuments,” John Quincy Adams once famously argued.   “It strikes no medals; it bears the head of no man upon its coin; its very essence is iconoclastic.”  Yet nearly 250 years after America’s founding, monuments and memorials surround us. In this course we will explore the memorializing impulse; the complexity and depth of emotion evoked by memorial acts; and the oftentimes heated controversies about modes, placement, and subject of representation.  We will consider how and why America chooses to memorialize certain people and events, and what is gained—and sometimes erased—in the process.  By choosing among a broad range of traditional and non-traditional modes of representation, we will consider how public memorials both reflect and shape Americans’ shared cultural values.  The course will include site visits to local monuments and projects in which we propose designs or redesigns of memorials for a 21st century audience.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Reading texts in their social, historical, and cultural contexts—and often in conjunction with other African American art forms like music and visual art—we will explore the evolution and deployment of various visions of black being and black artistry, from the Harlem Renaissance through social realism and the Black Arts Movement, to the contemporary post-soul aesthetic. Authors may include Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Gwendolyn Brooks, Ralph Ellison, Lorraine Hansberry, Amiri Baraka, Ishmael Reed, Toni Morrison, Charles Johnson, and Octavia Butler. <em>This course may also be counted as a general elective or REC elective for the ENAM major.</em>  3 hrs lect./disc. <em>(Diversity)/</em></span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>AMST 0253 Science Fiction (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Time travel, aliens, androids, robots, corporate and political domination, reimaginings of race, gender, sexuality and the human body--these concerns have dominated science fiction over the last 150 years.  But for all of its interest in the future, science fiction tends to focus on technologies and social problems relevant to the period in which it is written. In this course, we'll work to understand both the way that authors imagine technology's role in society and how those imaginings create meanings for science and its objects of study and transformation.  Some likely reading and films include Mary Shelley, Frankenstein, H. G. Wells, The Island of Doctor Moreau, Ridley Scott, Blade Runner, and works by William Gibson, Ursula LeGuin, Octavia Butler and other contemporary writers.

We will analyze the social, political, economic, environmental, and material factors that shape the meanings of "disability," examining changes and continuities over time. Students will draw critical attention to the connections between disability, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status, and age in American and transnational contexts. Diverse sources, including films and television shows, music, advertising, fiction, memoirs, and material objects, encourage inter and multi-disciplinary approaches to disability. Central themes we consider include language, privilege, community, citizenship, education, medicine and technology, and representation.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">What constitutes a pathological response to the pressures of modernity?  How do pathological protagonists drive readers toward the precariousness of their own physical and mental health?  The readings for this class center on the provisional nature of sanity and the challenges to bodily health in a world of modern commerce, media, and medical diagnoses.  We will begin with 19th century texts and their engagement with seemingly "diseased" responses to urbanization, new forms of work, and new structures of the family and end with contemporary fictional psychopaths engaged in attacks on the world of images we inhabit in the present.  Nineteenth century texts will likely include stories by Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman.  Later  20th-century works will likely include Ken Kesey, <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</em>, Thomas Harris, <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>, Susanna Kaysen, <em>Girl, Interrupted</em>, and Bret Easton Ellis, <em>American Psycho</em>.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Why does the American Museum of Natural History still house dioramas of so-called native peoples hunting?  How has the study and staging of nature transferred into various kinds of artistic expression?  In this course we will examine the intertwining of art, science, and ecology in the United States from the 1700s to the present day. Objects of study will include museum dioramas, scientific models, artifacts and artworks collected during scientific expeditions, and the work of Walton Ford and Christy Rupp, contemporary artists whose work engages ecological issues.

From the genteel parlor guitars of the 19th century elite to the electric weaponry of today’s rock stars, the guitar is an essential artifact of American material culture.   Drawing on histories, cultural critiques, interviews, and sound and video recordings, we will study both the evolution of the instrument and the builders and players who have helped define its role.  Examining artifacts and talking with working guitar builders will illuminate the craft of guitar making.  The culmination of the course will be a student-curated exhibition.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

In this course we will explore controversies and scandals sparked by public displays of art in the U.S. including: Eakins’s Gross Clinic (1876), seen as too “bloody” for an art exhibition; the U.S. Navy’s objections to Paul Cadmus’s painting of sailors (1934); censorship and NEA budget cuts (Mapplethorpe &amp; Serrano, 1989); backlash to The West as America’s deconstruction of myths of the frontier (1991); tensions surrounding Colonial Williamsburg’s “slave auction” reenactment (1994); debates over the continued display (and occasional defacement) of Confederate monuments in the era of the Black Lives Matter Movement.

			<h3>AMST 0282 Reconstructing Literature: Realism, Regionalism, and the American scene, 1870-1919 (Pre-1900 AL) (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">American literature evolved in the late 1800s as a new generation of writers portrayed a rapidly changing culture, transformed by urbanization, industrial growth, immigration, class tensions, new roles for women, shifting race relations, and demographic transformations that seemed to split the nation into city and country. While realism was an effort to describe “life as it is” and regionalism focused on the distinctive features of specific places, both modes of representation stemmed from historical forces that were reshaping the nation. Works to be covered may include fiction by William Dean Howells, Charles Chesnutt, Sarah Orne Jewett, Kate Chopin, and Theodore Dreiser. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>AMST 0287 Posthuman Medicine: Morals, Machines, and Bodies (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Medical treatments and technologies now keep people alive when they once surely would have died. But the increasing power of medicine has also raised nightmarish possibilities of lives controlled, squandered, or sacrificed to a system that often alienates patients, is centered on profit, and has a long history of treating marginal populations recklessly. How do science fiction writers, doctors, film makers, memoirists, and healthcare corporations portray an ever more medicalized vision of human experience and human bodies? Texts and films for the course will include HG Wells, <em>The Island of Doctor Moreau</em>, Atul Gawande, <em>Complications</em>; Octavia Butler, Clay’s <em>Ark</em>; Michael Gondry, <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, Karen Russell, <em>Sleep Donation</em>, and Kazuo Ishiguro, <em>Never Let Me Go</em>.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>AMST 0291 Portraits of the Lady: The New Woman in American Literature &amp; Culture (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">At the end of the 19th century, women fought against restrictions limiting their sphere of influence. As they sought to exercise more control over their lives personally, socially, and economically, this “New Woman,”  and the way she was changing the face of society, became a popular subject in literature and art.  In this course we will consider portraits of women by well-known American authors (such as James, Chopin, Wharton, Sui Sin Far, Cather, Larsen, Hurston) alongside those by prominent painters, sculptors, photographers, illustrators, and filmmakers.  We will consider how representations of women through the early twentieth century embodied the values of the nation and codified both the fears and aspirations of its citizens. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>AMST 0301 Madness in America (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">It's a mad, mad course.  In this course we will focus on representations of madness from colonial to late 20th century America, emphasizing the links between popular and material culture, science, medicine, and institutions. We will consider how ideas about madness (and normalcy) reflect broader (and shifting) notions of identity. Thus, issues of race, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation, community, class, and region will play significant roles in our discussions and critiques. To complement foundational readings, this course will draw on American literature, documentary and entertainment films, music, and materials from the college's special collections.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">Disability as a category and as lived experience plays an important but often overlooked role in national, transnational, and global contexts. In this course we will explore disability’s changing meanings in the United States and around the World. Comparative and transnational approaches will draw our attention to disability’s many meanings across wide-ranging historical, cultural, and geographical settings. Foundational concepts and principles, including ableism and Universal Design, shape our critical inquiry. Key themes frame the course: access, language, power, violence, normalcy, identity, community, institutions, and rights and justice. We will engage with diverse primary sources, from memoirs and documentary films to advertisements, material objects, and oral histories. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will investigate film and television representations of disability and disabled people to gain an understanding of how these reflect prominent cultural ideas across twentieth and twenty-first century US history.  Specifically, we will trace changes and continuities in the various functions of disability in film and TV, and how disabled people have used these media to express their own lived experiences. Key themes to be covered include access, stereotype, spectacle, community, and activism. Our intersectional study will involve disability, deaf, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and age. Through readings, screenings, and engaged discussions students will gain insights into ways film and television reflect and shape the understandings of disability in American history and culture.

		<h1>Department of Anthropology</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>Major Requirements</h2>
<p>A minimum of ten courses will constitute the major; at least eight of these courses (and all the core courses listed in the tracks below) must be fall and spring courses taught at Middlebury (e.g., not winter term courses or transfer credits). For a degree in anthropology, the major must complete the following requirements:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Introduction and Exploration</strong>
<ul><li>Any two (2) of the following introductory courses: ANTH 103, 107, 109,  and 159 (students may take the courses in any order or concurrently);</li>
<li>Any two (2) of the 200-level courses offered by the department;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Foundations</strong>
<ul><li>History of Anthropological Thought: ANTH 306 (or SOCI 305 with approval from the Department Chair)</li>
<li>Any one (1) of the following Research Methods courses: ANTH 302, 396, and 392</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Application and Synthesis</strong>
<ul><li>One 400-level seminar.</li>
<li>Three electives (no more than one at 100-level; anthropology courses from other departments can count as electives with approval from the Department Chair). Note: students pursuing senior projects (see below) may only count one semester toward their elective requirement.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><h2>Optional Senior Project in Anthropology</h2>
<p>To be eligible for departmental honors, students must complete an independent research project of at least one semester. This typically consists of either a one-semester senior project (ANTH 0700, one credit, usually 25-40 pages) or a two-semester senior project (ANTH 0710, two credits, usually 60-100 pages). Students who wish to work on a project for more than one semester must present their progress for review by two professors who will decide whether the project qualifies for extended study. A one-semester project can be either in the fall or spring semesters; a two- semester project is usually in the fall and winter semesters or in the winter and spring semesters. Variation from these patterns is possible by permission from the department. Senior project requirements for joint majors and other special circumstances will be approved in consultation with both departments.</p>
<p>An ANTH 0700 project requires a project advisor. If the advisor thinks that the project may deserve an A- or A, a second reader must evaluate the project. An ANTH 0710 project requires a committee including the project advisor and a second reader from within the Anthropology Department. It may also include an optional, third reader from another part of the College or the local community. Upon completion of the ANTH 0710 project, there will be an oral defense.</p>
<h2>Departmental Honors</h2>
<p>Students who earn an A- or higher on a 0700 or 0710 project and average an A- or higher in all Anthropology courses receive departmental honors.</p>
<h2>Anthropology Minor Requirements</h2>
<p>ANTH 0103 and four elective courses, no more than one of which can be at the 0100-level and no more than one of which can be a SOCI course. No courses may be taken outside of the regular fall and spring semesters at Middlebury (e.g., no winter term courses or transfer credits).</p>
<h2>Applied Anthropology Minor Requirements</h2>
<p>Any 0100-level course; ANTH 302, ANTH 396, or ANTH 492; and three elective courses from the list below. Other anthropology courses and anthropology courses in other departments can count with approval from the Anthropology Chair. No courses may be taken outside of the regular fall and spring semesters at Middlebury (e.g., no winter term courses or transfer credits).</p>
<p>ANTH 211 Environmental Anthropology (Sheridan)<br>
ANTH 270 Anthropology of Global Corporations (Stoll/Nguyen)<br>
ANTH 287 Medical Anthropology (Bright)<br>
ANTH 329 Refugees or Labor Migrants? (Stoll)<br>
ANTH 340 The Traveling Tonic (Bright)<br>

<h2>Joint Majors in Anthropology</h2>
<p>Joint majors consist of seven courses in Anthropology. Students must take one (1) course at the 100-level, two 200-level courses, 302 or 392 or 396, 306, one 400-level seminar, and one elective. No more than one course may be taken outside of the regular fall and spring semesters at Middlebury (e.g., as a winter term course or transfer credit).</p>
<h2>Joint Major in Anthropology and Sociology</h2>
<p>The joint major in Anthropology and Sociology consists of twelve classes. The core courses are ANTH 103, SOCI 105, SOCI 301 or ANTH 302 or ANTH 396, and SOC 305 or ANTH 306. Students must also take one 400-level SOCI course, one 400-level ANTH course, and six electives. A 700-level course in ANTH or SOCI can replace one of the 400-level courses. No more than two electives may be taken outside of the regular fall and spring semesters at Middlebury (e.g., as winter term or transfer credit courses).</p>

			<h3>ANTH 0103 Diversity and Human Nature: Introduction to Cultural Anthropology (Fall 2022, Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">This course introduces students to the varieties of human experience in social life and to the differing approaches and levels of analysis used by anthropologists to explain it. Topics include: culture and race, rituals and symbolism, kinship and gender roles, social evolution, political economy, and sociolinguistics. Ethnographic examples are drawn chiefly from non-Western societies, from simple bands to great agrarian states. The ultimate aim is to enable students to think critically about the bases of their own culture and about practices and beliefs previously unanalyzed and unexamined.

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will discuss the major issues and findings in the study of human language within theories of modern linguistics, which shares a history with mid-century American anthropology. The main topics include the nature of human language in comparison with other communication systems; sound patterns (phonology); word-formation (morphology); sentence structure (syntax); meaning (semantics); use (pragmatics); language acquisition and socialization. We will also consider language variation and the historical development of languages.  Instruction is in English but examples will be drawn from less commonly studied languages around the world. <strong>This course is part of the Public Humanities Labs Initiative administered by the Axinn Center for the Humanities.</strong> (not open to students who have taken LNGT 0101) 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ANTH 0211 Human Ecology (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Environmental issues are also cultural and political conflicts, between competing social groups, economic interests and cultural paradigms. This course introduces students to human ecology, the study of how our adaptations to the environment are mediated by cultural differences and political economy. Topics include: how ecological anthropology has evolved as a subdiscipline, with a focus on systems theory and political ecology; how ritually regulated societies manage resources; how rural communities deal with environmental deterioration; and how contradictions between environmental protection, economic development, and cultural values complicate so many ecological issues.

			<span class="course_description">This course introduces students to the indigenous peoples of North and South America, from before European conquest to the present. Following a brief look at the mound-builders of North America, we will explore the connection between social stratification, religious ideology, and imperial expansion in the political economy of the Aztecs and the Incas. Ethnographies of Quechua peasants in the Peruvian Andes, Yanomami Indians in the Amazon, and Oglala Sioux in the Dakotas will show how contemporary Native Americans are dealing with the never-ending process of colonialism. How Europeans have imagined indigenous peoples has had a profound impact on how the latter defend themselves. The resulting images of authenticity and resistance have always been double-edged. The course will conclude with the debate over the reservation paradigm in the U.S. 3 hrs. lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ANTH 0232 Africa and Anthropology: Power, Continuity, and Change (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Sub-Saharan Africa has long represented primitive mysteries for Europeans and North Americans, as a ‘Dark Continent’ full of exotic people and animals. Even now, many Americans learn little about Africa and Africans except for ‘thin’ media reports of political, economic, and ecological upheaval or persistent poverty, disease, and despair. This course provides a ‘thick’ description and analysis of contemporary African conditions using ethnographies and films. We will not be exploring ‘traditional African cultures’ outside of their historical contexts or generalizing about ‘what African culture really is.’ Rather, our focus will be on understanding social continuity and change alongside cultural diversity and commonality. Topics will include colonialism, critical kinship studies, African feminism, environmental management, witchcraft and religion. Throughout the course African ideas of power – what it is, who has it, and why –unify these diverse topics as social relations.

Beginning with animal behavior and hunting and gathering societies, we will study natural selection for accountability, moralism, and factionalism; how social groups define themselves through mimesis, othering and scapegoating; how scapegoating justifies aggression; how sacrifice and other forms of ritualizing victimhood generate sanctity, sacrilege, and outrage; and how religious and political loyalty tests enforce social boundaries (not open to students who have taken SOAN 0341 or SOAN 0344) 3 hrs. lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

No other social organization matches their ability to increase productivity and multiply wealth. Nor does any other social vehicle match their power to destabilize preexisting relationships. In this course we will learn about the anthropology of exchange and capitalism through ethnographies of corporations, corporate social responsibility, factory production, and financial speculation in the U.S., China, South Africa, and Papua New Guinea. We will also evaluate social-justice critiques of corporate structures: are they meritocracies or exclusionary kin-based networks? Do they build community or merely offload costs? For the final project, students will have the option of doing ethnographic research on a for-profit or not-for-profit enterprise. 3 hours, lct/disc,</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">This course offers a cross-cultural introduction to the issues involved in the study of women and gender.  Such an endeavor raises a number of difficult and delicate issues.  What explains the diversities and similarities in women's roles across societies?  How do we assess women's status and power, and how do we decide which standards to use in doing so?  What forces create changes in women's roles?  What is the relationship between gender constructions and the nature of communities, economies, and even nations?  Our analysis will concentrate on three primary domains: family and kinship, symbolic systems, and political economy. Course readings will focus primarily on non-Western societies.  3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(National/Transnational Feminisms)/</em></span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">What are the social terms for sexual agency in countries around the world? How is marriage understood through idealizations of romance as well as familial expectations of duty or status? In this course we consider how other cultures’ views on love, sex, and partnership are made legible and illegible within broader cultural, moral, and state interests. The course asks for in-depth participation, short weekly writings, and a longer final paper that each engage ethnographic works on a range of topics, from critical studies of love and globalization to queer kinmaking, rituals of the ‘lavish wedding,’ and everyday ways of hooking up and breaking up online. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ANTH 0345 The Anthropology of Food (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Food not only sustains bodies, but also reflects and shapes cultures, social identities, and systems of power.  In this course we examine the relationship between food and culture.  Beginning with an examination of the origins of cooking, we will go on to analyze a variety of approaches to understanding the food/culture/society relationship.  These include the symbolic meanings of food, the role of food in constructing social and cultural identities, and the relationship between food and political and economic systems.   Our examples will be cross-cultural (Africa, South and East Asia, Europe, and the Americas). 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ANTH 0440 The Traveling Tonic: Geographies of Medicine, Science, and the Body (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Medical practice does not operate within bounded systems but moves in highly transactional and molten ways—from the circulation of classical Chinese and Indian manuscripts to transnational movements of genes, gametes, and drugs. In this seminar we draw on ethnographic examples to grasp the importance of migration in producing science. The metaphor of travel enables us to pivot from Eurocentric histories of science to disrupt what we mean by global medicine. At the same time, the figure of the tonic enables us to think about the many sorts of life (plants, distillates, vectors, etc.) that make up medicine today. (ANTH 0287) 3 hrs. sem.

		<h1>Department of Biology</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>Required for the Major</h2>
<p>Requirements for the biology major encourage both breadth across the subdisciplines of biology as well as depth in areas of interest. The introductory sequence is two courses: BIOL 0140 Ecology and Evolution and BIOL 0145 Cell Biology and Genetics. The twelve courses required for the Biology major consist of:</p>
<p>(1-3) BIOL 0140 Ecology and Evolution, BIOL 0145 Cell Biology and Genetics, and BIOL 0211 Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis. We suggest students take these three courses as soon as they can.</p>
<p>(4-5) Two organismal courses from among BIOL 0201 Invertebrate Biology, BIOL 0202 Comparative Vertebrate Biology, BIOL 0203 Biology of Plants, BIOL 0204 Entomology, BIOL 0308 Mammalogy, and BIOL 0310 Microbiology.</p>
<p>(6) One college-level chemistry course with laboratory. AP credit in chemistry or a bypass examination <em>cannot</em> be used to satisfy this requirement. We strongly suggest students take this chemistry course in their first two years at Middlebury, as chemistry is fundamental to understanding topics addressed in many biology classes.</p>
<p>(7-12) Six biology electives from the 0200-0701 level, with the following restrictions:</p>
<ol><li>At least two electives must include a laboratory section.</li>
<li>No more than one semester of independent research (BIOL 0500, BIOL 0700, or BIOL 0701) may count as elective credit toward the major.</li>
<li>Per College policy only two winter term courses can count for major credit.</li>
</ol><p>Courses may be taken in any order, as long as the prerequisites for a course are met. Courses taken off campus can count towards the major, when approved by the department chair. See below for more information on off-campus study.</p>
<h2>Requirements for a Minor in Biology</h2>
<p>BIOL 0140 and BIOL 0145, and three elective courses from 0200-, 0300-, and 0400-level courses in the department.  One of the electives must be an organismal course (BIOL 0201, 0202, 0203, 0204, 0308, 0310), AND one of which must be at the 0300 or 0400 level.</p>
<h2>Joint Majors</h2>
<p>The Department of Biology does not offer joint majors other than the joint major in Biology and Environmental Studies described below.</p>
<h3>Requirements for the Molecular Biology and Biochemistry Major</h3>
<p>See the listing for the program in <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/mbb">Molecular Biology and Biochemistry</a> for a description of this major.</p>
<h3>Requirements for the Neuroscience Major</h3>
<p>See the listing for the program in <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/neuro">Neuroscience</a> for a description of this major.</p>
<h3>Requirements for the Joint Major with Environmental Studies</h3>
<p>See the listing for the conservation biology focus under the program in <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/es">Environmental Studies</a>.</p>
<h2>Graduate or Professional Training</h2>
<p>Students considering graduate or professional school in the life sciences should note that many programs require a year of introductory chemistry, a year of organic chemistry, a year of physics, and a year of calculus for admission. Students are therefore strongly encouraged to meet with their faculty advisors early in their undergraduate career so the advantages of taking additional courses in the natural sciences can be discussed.</p>
<h2>Departmental Honors</h2>
<p>Students with an average of 3.5 or higher in departmental courses other than BIOL 0500, BIOL 0700, and BIOL 0701 are eligible for departmental honors, for which successful completion of BIOL 0701 is also required (see below). The Biology Department awards two levels of honors: honors and high honors.</p>
<h3>Criteria for Honors</h3>
<p>Students with an average of 3.5 or higher in departmental courses (other than BIOL 0500, BIOL 0700, and BIOL 0701) and a grade of A- or above on their thesis are eligible for honors.</p>
<h3>Criteria for High Honors</h3>
<p>High honors will be awarded to students who meet all of the criteria for honors and who, in addition, have completed theses of <em>exceptionally high quality</em>.  Determination of honors or high honors is based on a formal recommendation from the thesis committee and requires the approval of the Biology Department faculty.</p>
<p>The thesis process is described in detail in the “Student &amp; Faculty Research” portion of the departmental website, and all students interested in conducting thesis research should read that section of the website in detail. Normally, research for thesis projects begins during the first term of a student’s senior year (or during the preceding summer). Students interested in field research should talk with a faculty member by winter term of their junior year. All other prospective thesis students should consult with prospective advisors concerning possible thesis projects by spring term of their junior year. Thesis projects must be of at least two terms’ duration (one term of BIOL 0500 or BIOL 0700 and one of BIOL 0701) and result in the production of a written thesis, a public presentation of the thesis research, and an oral defense of the thesis before a committee of at least three faculty members, two of whom must be Biology faculty. With instructor approval, independent research conducted during the summer may be considered as a substitute for the first term of the project. In such cases, the off-campus work would satisfy the BIOL 0500 or BIOL 0700 prerequisite for enrollment in BIOL 0701, but would not itself be credit-bearing. The thesis grade reflects performance in all aspects of the thesis process.  Note that although completion of a thesis is one prerequisite for receiving honors, students may undertake a thesis regardless of whether they meet the other criteria for honors.</p>
<h2>Advanced Placement Credit</h2>
<p>Middlebury College grants one college credit for a score of 5 on the biology advanced placement exam. However, because the biology department does not offer any introductory course that is the equivalent of an AP biology course, advanced placement credit does not exempt a student from any of the published requirements for the major, minor, or joint majors, nor can it satisfy the college’s distribution requirement. </p>
<h2>Off-Campus Study</h2>
<p>Students interested in taking biology courses off campus are strongly encouraged to discuss their plans with their advisor early in their college careers. Biology credit for an off-campus course will be given only after the department chair reviews the course material upon a student’s return to campus.   The following restrictions apply to all biology courses transferred to Middlebury:</p>
<ul><li>Except for transfer students, BIOL 0140 and BIOL 0145 must be taken at Middlebury College.</li>
<li>A maximum of three courses taken off campus may be credited toward completion of the major or joint major.</li>
<li>No credit in Biology will be granted for independent study projects conducted during off-campus study programs.</li>
<li>Except for transfer students, off-campus biology courses must be beyond the introductory level.</li>
<li>When a course is offered at Middlebury with a lab or prerequisites, an equivalent off-campus course must also include a lab or prerequisites.</li>

			<h3>BIOL 0140 Ecology and Evolution (Fall 2022, Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology we will cover the topics of interspecific interactions (competition, predation, mutualism), demography and life-history patterns, succession and disturbance in natural communities, species diversity, stability and complexity, causes of evolutionary change, speciation, phylogenetic reconstruction, and population genetics.   The laboratory component will examine lecture topics in detail (such as measuring the evolutionary response of bacteria, adaptations of stream invertebrates to life in moving water, invasive species and their patterns of spread).  We will emphasize experimental design, data collection in the field and in the laboratory, data analysis, and writing skills. This course is not open to seniors and second semester juniors in the Fall. 3 hrs. lect./disc./3 hrs. lab</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Buildings, parks, and infrastructure constitute this built environment, reflecting their societies. But what could abolitionist architecture look like, or how might public space in the U.S. create new social relations? Through lenses of race, class, and gender we will build critical vocabularies around the practice of making space. We will focus on the historical and contemporary embodiment of power, race, and culture of the U.S. through the built environment. This studio class will then present a series of projects addressing basic three-dimensional construction and model making techniques. We will engage historical and contemporary artworks, urban planning, architecture, and poetry from perspectives of resistance to dominant modes of constructing space.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>BLST 0232 A Black Sense of Place: Black Geographies (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Black feminist geographer, Katherine McKittrick, defines Black geographies as “subaltern or alternative geographic patterns that work alongside and beyond traditional geographies and a site or terrain of struggle” (2006, 7).<br>
This Black studies approach structures analyses of geographies across the Black diaspora in this course. Students will explore the relationships between race, racisms, space, and place through an interdisciplinary examination of the intimate, the material, the political, the body, and the collective as “sites of struggle.” We will read from texts such as Clyde Woods’ <em>Development Drowned and Reborn: The Blues and Bourbon Restorations in Post-Katrina New Orleans</em> and Erica Lorraine Williams’ <em>Sex Tourism in Bahia: Ambiguous Entanglements</em>.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>BLST 0300 Models of Inclusive Education (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In K-12 education, the term "inclusion" is often reduced to where students with apparent disabilities learn within schools. In this course, we will challenge the segregation of students with disabilities in schools while expanding notions of inclusion such that students' multiple identities are incorporated into learning. Students will be introduced and provided opportunities to design lessons using a Universal Design for Learning framework. We will utilize DisCrit (Disability Studies and Critical Race Theory) as a theoretical tool to explore how ableism and racism stand in the way of equitable education for many students while exploring theories, methods, and approaches to disrupt such marginalization and lead to inclusive antiracist educational practices.

The lecture portion of this course will be taught using “flipped class” pedagogy. Students will watch videos prior to class, and classroom time will be dedicated to small group problem solving with faculty guidance. The course will provide students with an introduction to the structure and reactivity of organic molecules sufficient to continue directly to the study of biochemistry (CHEM 0322). Topics covered will include models of chemical bonding, acid-base relationships, three-dimensional molecular structure (conformations and stereochemistry), reaction mechanisms and energy diagrams, substitution and elimination reactions, carbonyl reactions (additions, reductions, interconversions, and alpha-reactivity), and the fundamentals of biological molecules (carbohydrates, DNA, and RNA). Laboratory experiments will relate to purification techniques (recrystallization, distillation, extraction, and chromatography), as well as microscale organic reactions that complement the lecture material.

The language situation in China is unique both in the modern world and in human history. We will gain a good understanding of sociolinguistics as a scientific field of inquiry through exploring the Chinese situation in this course. Some of the questions we will ask are: What is Mandarin (Modern Standard) Chinese? Who are "native speakers" of Mandarin? Are most Chinese people monolingual (speaking only one language) or bilingual (speaking two languages) or even multilingual? How many "dialects" are there in China? What is the difference between a "language" and a "dialect"? Are Chinese characters "ideographs", i.e., "pictures" that directly represent meaning and have nothing to do with sound? Why has the pinyin romanization system officially adopted in the 1950s never supplanted the Chinese characters? Why are there traditional and simplified characters? We will also explore topics such as power, register, verbal courtesy, gender and language use. Students are encouraged to compare the Chinese situation with societies that they are familiar with. (One semester of Chinese language study or by waiver)</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>CHNS 0370 Early Chinese Novels (in translation) (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">This seminar focuses on pre-modern Chinese full-length novels, which rose and matured during the Ming-Qing period. Students will read from the "masterworks" of this genre, including Three Kingdoms (the epic deeds of heroes of the Chinese civil war of the second and third centuries), Outlaws of the Marsh (picaresque tales of Chinese Robin Hoods, as it were), The Journey to the West (a comic Buddhist-Daoist allegory better known in English as Monkey), The Plum in the Golden Vase (an erotic novel of manners), and The Story of the Stone-The Dream of the Red Chamber (widely recognized as a masterpiece of world literature); all are beloved and long treasured by the Chinese. We will also read an eighteenth century detective novel, Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee. We will not only trace the evolution of classical Chinese novels and consider their literary significance and artistic value; the course will also aim to provide a richer and deeper understanding of traditional China's history, society, culture, worldviews, beliefs, and sense of humor.

		<h1>Eve Adler Department of Classics and Program in Classical Studies</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>Required for the Major in Classics</h2>
<ul><li>Ten courses in two languages: Greek and Latin (normally six in one language and four in the other) including one senior seminar (CLAS 0420).</li>
<li>CLAS 0150 Ancient Epic Poetry</li>
<li>Two additional courses in classics in translation, one from each of the following categories:
<ul><li>CLAS/HIST 0131 Archaic and Classical Greece or CLAS 0151 Introduction to Ancient Greek Literature or CLAS 0152 Greek Tragedy or CLAS 0190 Greek and Roman Comedy or CLAS/RELI 0251 Greek Religion or CLAS/PHIL 0275 Greek Philosophy: The Problem of Socrates</li>
<li>CLAS/HIST 0132 History of Rome or CLAS 0140 Augustus and the World of Rome or CLAS 0143 The Rise and Fall of the Roman Republic or CLAS 0144 Literature of the Roman Empire or CLAS 0190 Greek and Roman Comedy or CLAS/PHIL 0276 Roman Philosophy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CLAS 0701 History of Classical Literature: General Examination for Classics/Classical Studies Majors</li>
</ul><p><strong>Optional: </strong>CLAS 0700 Senior Essay (fall/winter or winter/spring), CLAS 0505 Independent Senior Project (fall or spring). (Note: Students who wish to do an optional senior essay or independent senior project must secure the sponsorship of a member of the classics department in the semester before the essay or project is to be undertaken.)</p>
<p><strong>Honors:</strong> B+ average or better in courses taken for the major (excluding senior work). B+ or better in the General Examination (CLAS 0701) and in the Senior Seminar (CLAS 0420). (Note: A student who does an optional senior essay or independent senior project may arrange with the chair, in the semester prior to undertaking the project, to offer that grade in lieu of the grade for CLAS 0420 for the calculation of departmental honors.)</p>
<p><strong>Joint Major:</strong> Students interested in a joint major in Classics and another discipline should consult the chair. The joint major in Classics typically requires ten courses in Greek and Latin (normally six in one language and four in the other); CLAS 0701, and senior work that combines Classics with the other major.</p>
<h2>Required for the Minor in Classics</h2>
<p><strong>The minor in classics may be configured in one of the following four ways:</strong></p>
<ol><li><em>Latin CLLA</em>: Five courses in Latin</li>
<li><em>Greek CLGR</em>: Five courses in Greek</li>
<li><em>Classical Civilization CLCC:</em> Five courses, as follows: three or more courses chosen from    CLAS/HIST 0131, CLAS/HIST 0132, CLAS 0140, CLAS 0143, CLAS 0144, CLAS 0149, CLAS0150, CLAS 0151, CLAS 0152, CLAS 0190, CLAS/LITP 0230, CLAS/RELI 0262, CLAS/PHIL 0275, CLAS/PHIL 0276, CLAS 0321 CLAS/HIST 0331, CLAS/HIST 0332, or CLAS/HIST 0337; and CLAS 0420 or CLAS 0450 (or both).</li>
<li><em>Classical Language and Civilization CLCL:</em> Five courses, as follows: two or more courses in Latin or Greek; one or more courses chosen from CLAS/HIST 0131, CLAS/HIST 0132, CLAS 0140, CLAS 0143, CLAS 0144, CLAS 0149, CLAS/CMLT 0150, CLAS 0151, CLAS 0152, CLAS/CMLT 0190, CLAS/LITP 0230, CLAS/RELI 0251, CLAS/PHIL 0275 or CLAS 0276; and one or more courses chosen from CLAS 0321, CLAS/HIST 0331, CLAS/HIST 0332, CLAS/HIST 0337, CLAS 0420, or CLAS/CMLT 0450.</li>
</ol><p><strong>AP credit policy:</strong> One course credit toward graduation, not toward the major or minor, will be granted for one AP exam in Latin under the following conditions: a) The student has received a grade of 4 or 5 on the AP exam, and b) The student has completed an advanced course (LATN 0201 or above) in Latin at Middlebury with a grade of B+ or above. (Note: No more than one course credit will be granted, whether the student presents one or two AP exams.)</p>
<p><strong>Study Abroad Guidelines: </strong>Study abroad in the Mediterranean can enrich our majors’ experience of the ancient world, because it affords them the opportunity to see the places that they have been learning about in the classroom. Students also find it stimulating to be surrounded by people with similar interests from other institutions. Thus, while our curriculum does not in any way necessitate study abroad, the faculty is happy to work with students who wish to pursue it as part of their Middlebury degree in classics or classical studies.</p>
<p>For those students who want to go abroad, we strongly recommend a semester rather than a year. The three programs we endorse are the ICCS (the Inter-Collegiate Consortium for Classical Studies in Rome), CYA (College Year in Athens), and Arcadia (also in Athens), all of which offer semester-long programs. Admission to the ICCS in particular, however, is highly competitive, and students may have a compelling academic rationale for studying elsewhere. Accordingly, we have also approved students who wished to study for a semester at foreign universities with strong classics departments. These have included Trinity College Dublin, the University of Edinburgh, Cambridge University, and the University of Vienna. For some students, a rewarding alternative to study abroad during the academic year has been participation in a summertime archaeological excavation.</p>
<p>We discourage students from going abroad before they have had at least three semesters of whichever ancient language(s) they are learning. As part of their program of study abroad, students normally take at least one course in each ancient language of study, and select additional courses that are appropriate substitutes for courses in the major. In order to be fully prepared for senior work, however, students will need to have completed a significant portion of the courses required for the major, in particular CLAS 0150, before going abroad.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we are as flexible as we can be in helping majors to identify courses in programs abroad that allow them to stay in step with their cohort in Middlebury and to be prepared for senior work. Unless we are familiar with the institution, the instruction, and the content of the courses, we rarely grant credit to non-majors for classics courses taken away from Middlebury. In all cases (majors, non-majors, potential majors, and minors), students must consult with a member of the classics department before leaving Middlebury to plan and receive approval for work done at other institutions.</p>

			<h3>CLAS 0143 The Rise and Fall of the Roman Republic (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">This course is an introduction to the literature, politics, culture and history of the Roman Republic (c.509-31BCE) - a period which saw Rome grow from a small city on the Tiber to the supreme power in the Mediterranean, and also saw the development of Latin literature.  Our readings cover a broad variety of literary genres and authors: comedy (Plautus and Terence), lyric (Catullus), epic (Ennius), political speeches and letters (Cicero), history (Caesar, Sallust, Polybius), and didactic philosophy (Lucretius).  As we read we will be careful to investigate how these texts present different and often conflicting ideas of what it means to be Roman, as well as how different ideologies of Rome compete throughout each work.  3 hrs. lect. 1hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>CLAS 0144 Literature of the Roman Empire (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will investigate the literature, culture, and history of the Roman Empire, focusing on how Romans sought, often at the cost of their own lives, to define the role and powers of the emperor and their place as subjects to this new, autocratic power.  Texts we will read include: epic (Lucan), tragedy (Seneca), history (Tacitus), biography (Suetonius), prose fiction (Petronius), as well as early Christian literature.  As we read we will seek to answer questions about the nature of freedom and empire, what is gained and lost by replacing a republican with an autocratic political system, and whether literature in this period can offer an accurate reflection of reality, function as an instrument of change and protest, or of fearful praise and flattery.  3 hrs lect. 1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>CLAS 0150 Greek and Roman Epic Poetry (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Would Achilles and Hector have risked their lives and sacred honor had they understood human life and the Olympian gods as Homer portrays them in the <em>Iliad</em>? Why do those gods decide to withdraw from men altogether following the Trojan War, and why is Odysseus the man Athena chooses to help her carry out that project? And why, according to the Roman poet Vergil, do these gods command Aeneas, a defeated Trojan, to found an Italian town that will ultimately conquer the Greek cities that conquered Troy, replacing the Greek polis with a universal empire that will end all wars of human freedom? Through close study of Homer's <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, and Vergil's <em>Aeneid</em>, we explore how the epic tradition helped shape Greece and Rome, and define their contributions to European civilization. 3 hrs. lect., 1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>CLAS 0152 Greek Tragedy (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">A survey of selected tragedies by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, exploring the relation between tragedy and political freedom and empire in fifth century B.C. Athens. The course examines the tragic poets' use of traditional Greek myths to question not only the wisdom of contemporary Athenian imperialism but also traditional Greek views on relations between the sexes; between the family and the city; between man's presumed dignity and his belief in gods. Mythical and historical background is supplied through additional readings from Homer and Thucydides. The course asks how the tragedians managed to raise publicly, in the most solemn religious settings, the kind of questions for which Socrates was later put to death. The course culminates in a reading of Aristotle's <em>Poetics</em>. 3 hrs. lect., 1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will examine the religious experience of the Greeks in all its complexity and variety.  Drawing on literary sources (e.g. Homer, Hesiod, tragedy, and comedy, among others) and archaeological evidence, we will study the Greek views of the gods as these emerge from both mythical narratives and cult practice. We will explore the Greek ideas of personal salvation, but also the importance of religious festivals for the community of the polis. Finally, while looking at ancient philosophical critiques of the traditional gods, we will trace the transition to Christianity and we will compare the sacred in Greek culture with the place of religion in our own society.  3 hrs. lect., 1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>CLAS 0332 Roman Law (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The Romans' codification of civil law is often considered their greatest intellectual achievement and most original and influential contribution to the world. This course treats the four main divisions of Roman law (persons, property, obligations, and succession). Great emphasis is placed on the role of law in Roman society. How did the law influence the lives of Roman citizens living under it? How did ordinary Roman citizens shape the law? Students will come to understand the principles of Roman law through actual cases. Designed for students with some background in Roman history and/or literature. 2 hrs. lect./1 disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">From Euripides’s play to the contemporary films of Pier Paolo Pasolini and Lars von Trier, Medea’s story has been retold for two and a half millennia.  In this course we will investigate some of the avatars of Medea, from drama (Euripides and Seneca), to epic (Apollonius and Ovid), to philosophical discussions of her plight (Epictetus).  We will also consider her role in early modern drama (Macbeth) and modern film.  What does Medea represent?  The overwhelming power of love and madness?  The triumph of barbarism over civilization?  A critique of cultural superiority and enlightenment?  How can we explain her continued presence through the centuries? 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

		<h1>Program in Comparative Literature</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><p>During their course of study, students of Comparative Literature will also become familiar with current comparative methodologies as well as relevant cultural and critical theories. These methodological skills support students’ work as they pursue a flexible and individualized pathway through their program of study, which culminates in an article-length comparative essay. The program is designed to accommodate students at all levels of language proficiency.</p>
<p>Majors in Comparative Literature will develop a plan of study with the guidance of a faculty advisor with expertise in the students chosen primary language and literature, and the Director of the Comparative Literature Program.</p>
<p>The basic structure of the program is as follows:</p>
<p>1. One primary language of study AND</p>
<p>2. Four courses in a secondary language. Students’ first language cannot be their primary language, but it can be their secondary language.  For example, English cannot be the primary language of a student whose first language is English, but it can be the secondary language.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ol><li><strong>CMLT 0101</strong></li>
<li><strong>Three content courses in the primary language, including two literary classes and one cultural course (e.g. cinema, politics).</strong> The choice of particular classes requires the approval of the student’s primary language advisor and the Program Director. Students will also need approval for inclusion of study abroad classes in this category.  In the case of students whose primary language is Arabic, Chinese, Russian, or Japanese, some of these three content courses MAY be taught in English, depending on the availability of suitable courses in the language.</li>
<li><strong>Four courses in a secondary language. If the secondary language is English, at least one course must be pre 1800.</strong></li>
<li><strong>One course in literary theory</strong> (suggested for sophomore year), for example ENAM/CMLT 205.</li>
<li><strong>Study abroad, in the <em>primary</em> language.</strong>  Exceptions may be made if you receive prior approval from your faculty advisor and the program director. A maximum of 4 courses in literature taken abroad may be used to satisfy other requirements in the major, subject to the pre-approval of the Director of the program.<strong> </strong>All students must take one class in their primary language after their return.</li>
<li><strong>Two electives explicitly comparative in nature. </strong>These literature courses may be taught in English. Examples: CLAS/CMLT 0150; CMLT/RELI 0238; CMLT/CLAS 0450; ENAM/CMLT 0305; GRMN/CMLT 0333; ITAL/CMLT 0299. Suitable classes will be cross-listed and bear the prefix CMLT.</li>
<li><strong>One senior/advanced seminar in literature taken at Middlebury College in the student’s primary or secondary language</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Senior Work (CMLT 0700)</strong>: During Fall and Winter Term, or Winter Term and Spring, students will write a 35-page (article length) comparative essay (advised independently). Students are responsible to identify and arrange to work with their advisor and the members of their committee no later than the last week of classes in the preceding term.</li>
</ol><h2>Honors</h2>
<p>To be eligible for honors students must have a GPA in the major of 3.7 and a B+ or above on their essay. Students with eligible honors theses will also have a defense before the last day of exams.</p>

			<h3>CMLT 0101 Introduction to World Literature (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">This course is an introduction to the critical analysis of imaginative literature of the world, the dissemination of themes and myths, and the role of translation as the medium for reaching different cultures. Through the careful reading of selected classic texts from a range of Western and non-Western cultures, students will deepen their understanding and appreciation of the particular texts under consideration, while developing a critical vocabulary with which to discuss and write about these texts, both as unique artistic achievements of individual and empathetic imagination and as works affected by, but also transcending their historical periods. 3 hrs. lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>CMLT 0123 Adventures in Literary Romance (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will explore the literary genre of romance.  Today, “romance” often refers to courtship—only one aspect of this ancient genre.  Other aspects include adventure, magic, wonder, multiple plots, multiple authors, an affinity for sequels.  Romance’s associations with every genre—tragedy, comedy, epic, novel, lyric poetry—and its reputation for escapism have made it an epitome of the very idea of literature, as conceived by attackers and defenders.  Its welcoming of female readers and protagonists and its marketing of the exotic have raised issues of gender and ethnicity.  We will discuss all such aspects and implications of romance, and we may also explore how romance has shaped modern television and film. No papers or exams; there will be quizzes <em>daily</em> on the reading, and students will be expected to participate thoughtfully in class discussions.  Readings from texts such as: <em>Daphnis and Chloe</em>, <em>Ethiopian Romance</em>, The Gospel of Luke, <em>The Golden Ass</em>, Arthurian romances by various authors, <em>Orlando Inamorato</em>, <em>Orlando Furioso</em>, <em>The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia</em>, <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, <em>The Winter’s Tale</em>, <em>Don Quixote</em>,/ Waverly/, <em>Madame Bovary</em>, <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>, and <em>The Time Quintet</em>. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>CMLT 0150 Greek and Roman Epic Poetry (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Would Achilles and Hector have risked their lives and sacred honor had they understood human life and the Olympian gods as Homer portrays them in the <em>Iliad</em>? Why do those gods decide to withdraw from men altogether following the Trojan War, and why is Odysseus the man Athena chooses to help her carry out that project? And why, according to the Roman poet Vergil, do these gods command Aeneas, a defeated Trojan, to found an Italian town that will ultimately conquer the Greek cities that conquered Troy, replacing the Greek polis with a universal empire that will end all wars of human freedom? Through close study of Homer's <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, and Vergil's <em>Aeneid</em>, we explore how the epic tradition helped shape Greece and Rome, and define their contributions to European civilization. 3 hrs. lect., 1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>CMLT 0190 Greek and Roman Comedy (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">A survey of the comic playwrights of Greece (Aristophanes and Menander) and Rome (Plautus and Terence) in light of their ancient social, political, and religious contexts as well as modern theoretical approaches to laughter (including psychoanalysis and structural anthropology). We will trace enduring aspects of the comic tradition that can be found in both Greece and Rome and also look forward to Renaissance and modern comedy. These include: the nature of the comic hero; the patterns of comic plots; the dependence of comedy on language; the comic poet's concern with questions of freedom and slavery, desire and repression.

			<h3>CMLT 0200 Once Upon A Time ... Folk Fairy Tales Of The World (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Tell me a story! We will examine the complex, inter-connected fairy tale traditions found in every society. Comparing fairy tale variants from around the world-including Japan, China, India, Near East, Africa-we will explore their convoluted and fertile relationships as observed in the rise of fairy tale collections in 15th-century Europe, reaching a culmination in the Brothers Grimm collection, often synonymous with the fairy tale itself. To attain a more dispassionate critical perspective we will explore theoretical approaches to the fairy tales through authors such as Zipes, Bottigheimer, Tatar, and Rölleke, and conclude by examining modern variants in prose, poetry, and film.

			<h3>CMLT 0205 Introduction to Contemporary Literary Theory (Fall 2022, Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will introduce several major schools of contemporary literary theory. By reading theoretical texts in close conjunction with works of literature, we will illuminate the ways in which these theoretical stances can produce multiple interpretations of a given literary work. The approaches covered may include New Criticism, Psychoanalysis, Marxism and Cultural Criticism, Race Theory and Multicultural Criticism, Feminism, Post-Colonial Criticism, Queer Studies, Eco-Criticism, Post-Structuralism, and others. These theories will be applied to various works of fiction, poetry, and drama. The goal will be to make students critically aware of the fundamental literary, cultural, political, and moral assumptions underlying every act of interpretation they perform.  3 hrs. lect/disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will explore how narrative art articulates spiritual perception by examining selected works of 20th century writers such as Miguel De Unamuno, Nikos Kazantzakis, J. D. Salinger, Charles Williams, Flannery O'Connor, Thomas Merton, Alice Munroe, Marilynne Robinson, and Annie Dillard.  Drawing on theology and philosophy as an interpretative mode, we will consider the following questions: How does literature illuminate selfhood and interiority? How do contemplation and ascetic practice guide the self to divine knowledge and cosmic unification? How do language, imagery and symbols shape the unitive experience as a tool for empathy and understanding of the other? 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will explore the idiom of human rights in law, literature, and political culture. We will place literary representations of human rights violations (genocide, torture, detention and forced labor, environmental devastation, police violence) in dialogue with official human rights treaties and declarations in order to historicize and critique the assumptions of human rights discourse. Who qualifies as a “human” deserving of humanitarian intervention? How do human rights rehearse a colonial dynamic based on racial and geo-political privilege? To answer these questions we will turn to some of the most controversial voices in global fiction and poetry. 3 hrs. lect.

			<h3>CMLT 0286 Philosophy &amp; Literature (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will explore the border both separating and joining philosophy and literature. How does literature evoke philosophical problems, and how do philosophers interpret such works? How does fiction create meaning? Beginning with Greek tragedy, we investigate Plato’s “quarrel” with, and Aristotle’s defense of, poetry. Then we will turn to modern works, mostly European, on topics such as: tragedy and ethics; style and rhetoric; author and reader; time and temporality; mood and emotion; existence and mortality. Literary readings after Sophocles will be selected from Borges, Calvino, Camus, Kafka, Tolstoy, and Woolf.  Philosophical readings after Plato and Aristotle will be selected from Bergson, Danto, Freud, Murdoch, Ricoeur, and Nussbaum.

			<h3>CMLT 0325 Tang Poetry / American Poetry (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Amy Lowell and Ezra Pound, rival founders of the Imagist poetry movement a century ago, both published influential translations of Tang-dynasty lyrics, even though neither one knew a word of Chinese. In this course, we will not only study their accomplishments in context, but go a step further to begin learning how to read and write the most commonly used characters in Tang poetry so that we can parse a selection of the best poems in the original as we explore such topics as the differences between Chinese and European poetics, theories of translation and intercultural adaptation, and Orientalist fantasies of the ideogram. No knowledge of Chinese is necessary. 3 hrs. lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

We will use Edward Said’s seminal work Orientalism as a theoretical framework and study how racist narratives are predominant within our industrial mass media (radio, serials, films, comic books, social media, and streaming services). Furthermore, we will explore how new gender and race paradigms have provided space for adventure narratives that attempt to dismantle the biases against Asian citizens in the Americas. This class will cover from Martial Arts narratives in the United States to Mexican Geisha comic books to Argentinean adventures in the Middle East.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>CMLT 0451 The Novels of J.M. Coetzee: Ethics and Empire (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Coetzee, whose novels engage questions of institutional racism, state-sponsored violence, patriarchal privilege, environmental degradation, animal rights, and how to ethically approach cultural Others, manages to speak of specific historical circumstances—such as South Africa’s apartheid regime—while simultaneously addressing universal dilemmas of our contemporary human condition.  Having received both the Booker (twice) and Nobel Prizes for literature, Coetzee is recognized as the living heir of both Kafka and Beckett, and as a writer whose searing prose and formal experimentation both extend and transform the novel’s traditional role as our culture’s most skeptical self-inquisitor.  Depicting every act of writing as either a confrontation or an evasion, Coetzee both reveres and rebukes the literary traditions he warily embraces.  We will read his strongest and most globally recognized works, from <em>Waiting for the Barbarians</em> through <em>Disgrace</em>.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

		<h1>Department of Economics</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>Required for the Major</h2>
<p>The economics major consists of a minimum of 11 approved courses in four sequences. At least six of these eleven courses, including the electives taken at the 0300- and 0400-levels and the 0701/0702 sequence, must be taken at Middlebury College in Vermont. Note that although the 0701/0702 sequence is taken over two semesters (Fall/Winter or Winter/Spring) and counts as two credits towards the minimum 36 college requirements, it only counts as one course towards the economics major requirements. ECON 0240 and ECON 0500 do not count towards the major requirements. Economics electives taken during the winter term will count towards the major requirements only if so designated in the winter term catalog.</p>
<h3>Introductory Sequence</h3>
<p>ECON 0150 and ECON 0155. Neither ECON 0150 nor ECON 0155 assumes any prior exposure to economics, but both courses presume a thorough working knowledge of algebra. Note: Students must pass ECON 0150 and ECON 0155 with at least a C- to be admitted into ECON 0250 and ECON 0255 respectively without a waiver.</p>
<h3>Quantitative Sequence</h3>
<p>The quantitative sequence in economics consists of two courses. The first course can be ECON 0210, MATH 0116, MATH 0310, or PSYC 0201. (ECON 0210 may not be taken concurrently with MATH 0116, MATH 0310 or PSYC 0201. Credit is not given for ECON 0210 if the student has taken MATH 0116, MATH 0310 or PSYC 0201.) Students with strong mathematical background wanting to take MATH 0410 (Stochastic Processes) should take MATH 0310 rather than MATH 0116 or ECON 0210, since MATH 0310 is a prerequisite for MATH 0410. The second course in the sequence is ECON 0211. Students must pass ECON 0210 with at least a C- to be admitted into ECON 0211 without a waiver.</p>
<h3>Intermediate Theory Sequence</h3>
<p>ECON 0250; ECON 0255; and one of ECON 0212, ECON 0229, or ECON 0280. Note: It is important, especially for those planning to study abroad for a full year, that the above three sequences be completed by the end of the sophomore year.</p>
<h3>Elective Sequence</h3>
<p>Majors are required to take at least four electives, one of which must be at the 0400-level and one of which must be any of the following:  a 0300-level course, another 0400-level course, or the ECON 0701/0702 senior workshop sequence. The other two electives may be 0200-, 0300-, or 0400-level courses.</p>
<p>The 0300-level courses are advanced electives exposing students to frontier research in specific subfields of economics that have intermediate theory as a prerequisite. The 0400-level courses are seminars that typically enroll no more than 16 students, have intermediate theory as a prerequisite, and serve as a capstone experience for the major. Emphasis is placed on reading, writing, and discussion of economics at an advanced level. The 0701/0702 workshops are seminars that typically enroll eight students, have intermediate theory and a field course as a prerequisite, and involve writing an independent research paper. The difference between an ECON 0400-level seminar and an ECON 0701/0702 workshop is the degree of independence the student has and the level of sophistication expected in the paper.</p>
<h2>Honors</h2>
<p>To be eligible for honors in economics, students must take the Senior Research sequence (ECON 0701 and ECON 0702) during their senior year. The purpose of this two-semester sequence is to foster independent student research, culminating in a research paper in the style of an economics journal article. Prior to enrolling in ECON 0701, students must have taken a minimum of six economics courses at Middlebury approved to count towards the major requirements. Each course in the sequence will have no more than eight students who will work on their projects for two semesters (either fall/winter or winter/spring) and will include both individual meetings and group meetings to develop new techniques and present and discuss research. Students who have prearranged a research topic with the professor will be given priority in admission to the seminar. Also, because of limited resources for guiding senior work, students with a single major in economics will be given priority over double majors who will do senior work in other departments. Students interested in pursuing departmental honors must take the Senior Research Workshop sequence (ECON 0701 and ECON 0702). To receive departmental honors the student must receive a minimum grade of A- in ECON 0701 and ECON 0702, and have a 3.5 or higher GPA in all economics courses taken at Middlebury approved to count towards the major requirements. High Honors requires a minimum grade of A in ECON 0701 and ECON 0702, and a 3.75 or higher economics GPA. Highest Honors requires a minimum grade of A in ECON 0701 and ECON 0702, and a 3.9 or higher economics GPA. For more detailed information on how the economics GPA is calculated, please contact the department coordinator.</p>
<h2>International Politics and Economics Major</h2>
<p>Please refer to the International Politics and Economics section of the catalog for details about the major or visit the <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/ipe">International Politics &amp; Economics</a> website for the most current information. Note: Students are not allowed to double major in Economics (ECON) and International Politics and Economics (IPEC).</p>
<h2>Major in Environmental Studies with a focus in Economics (ESEC)</h2>
<p>Please refer to the Environmental Studies Program section of the catalog (under Social Science foci) for details about the major or visit the Environmental Studies website for the most current information. Note: Students are not allowed to double major in Economics (ECON) and Environmental Economics (ESEC).</p>
<h2>Major in Environmental Studies with a focus in Policy (ESEP)</h2>
<p>Please refer to the Environmental Studies Program section (under Social Science foci) for details about the major or visit the Environmental Studies website for the most current information. It is possible to double major in Economics (ECON) and Environmental Policy (ESEP), however, double counting of Economics courses towards each major is not allowed, except in cases where a specific course is listed as required by both majors. </p>
<h2>AP Credit Policy</h2>
<p>To obtain credit, students will need to submit their official scores to the Registrar’s Office and obtain approval from the department chair. Students who score a 5 on the Advanced Placement exam in Macroeconomics or Microeconomics will receive credit for Introductory Macroeconomics (ECON 0150) or Introductory Microeconomics (ECON 0155) respectively and cannot enroll in these courses at Middlebury. Students who score a 5 on the advanced placement exam in statistics are strongly encouraged to enroll in Economic Statistics (ECON 0210) but they may choose to use their AP credit instead. Note: Students may not receive AP credit and course credit for the same course.</p>
<p>Students who score a 4 on the advanced placement exam in Macroeconomics, Microeconomics or Statistics must earn a B- or better grade in the corresponding intermediate-level course ECON 0250, ECON 0255, or ECON 0211, respectively, to receive college credit for the AP course. Note: Students are required to complete an additional elective for each of these courses when a grade of B- or higher is not earned in the corresponding intermediate-level course.</p>
<h2>International Baccalaureate/A-Levels</h2>
<p>Students who have completed an International Baccalaureate and have earned a score of 7 on IB Economics or a grade of A on A-Level Economics should begin their studies of Macroeconomics and Microeconomics with ECON 0250 and ECON 0255. These students will be given one course credit toward the economics major, and will be prohibited from enrolling in ECON 0150 or ECON 0155. Students who have earned a score of 6 on IB economics or a grade of B on A-Level economics are encouraged to begin their studies of Macroeconomics and Microeconomics with ECON 0250 and ECON 0255, but they may elect to enroll in ECON 0150 or ECON 0155. Students majoring in Economics will need to replace the other introductory course with an ECON elective. Students who have completed a statistics course with a score of 6 or higher on IB Statistics, or a grade of B or better on A-Level Statistics may begin their course of study of economics statistics with ECON 0211 or MATH 0310. If they choose to start with ECON 0211 or MATH 0310, they will need to replace the ECON 0210 credit with an ECON elective. The same rules apply where ECON courses are requirements for other majors. Please notify the department coordinator if you have qualifying IB or A-Level scores in economics that you wish to use as a prerequisite.</p>
<h2>Transfer of Credit</h2>
<p>Students may take economics courses in approved programs (abroad and domestic) and have those courses count towards the major and/or the general graduation requirement. Summer school courses will not generally be given credit for the major unless there is an overriding reason to take a summer school course. Any summer school course must meet a minimum of six weeks and have at least 36 hours of class time. Students planning to take courses off-campus should discuss the proposed course(s) with their advisor and get pre-approval from the department chair. Upon completion of the course(s), students should submit their course material and a copy of their transcript along with a <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/academic/records/Forms/stuforms">Transfer Credit Application Form</a> to the department chair for departmental approval. After receiving departmental approval, students must submit their forms to the Registrar’s Office for final approval by the director of off-campus study. Note: Transfer Credit Forms are not required for courses listed in the <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/international/sa/cid">Course Information Data base (CID)</a> as approved to count towards the major. However, students must notify the Registrar’s Office of any transferred courses approved in the CID that they wish to be counted towards their major requirements. Courses having a BU (Business) or MGMT (Management) prefix will not normally be considered the equivalent of an economics course. No credit will be given for business courses taken over the summer. A maximum of one general credit will be given for a business course taken through a junior year abroad business program. Business courses taken in a non-business program will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Those that match the department’s offerings, and have strong liberal arts content, have the best chance of receiving credit.</p>
<h2>Post-Graduate Preparation</h2>
<p>Graduate programs in economics or finance [other than a Masters of Business Administration (MBA)] generally require a high degree of mathematical sophistication. Students thinking of continuing in such a program are encouraged to: (i) take MATH 0310 in place of ECON 0210; (ii) select economics electives with significant mathematically and statistically rigorous content [recommended courses fulfilling the elective requirements of the economics major include: ECON 0212, ECON 0229, ECON 0280, ECON 0390, and ECON 0411]; (iii) take a number of additional courses in mathematics and computer science [recommended courses include: CSCI 0101, MATH 0315, MATH 0318, MATH 0323, MATH 0410, and MATH 0423]. Good training for graduate school might include being a statistics tutor or having worked as a research assistant at Middlebury College or at a Federal Reserve Bank, or as an intern at a research institute or NGO. Students thinking about this option should discuss their plans with their advisor and other faculty members.. Masters of Business Administration (MBA) programs look for students who have taken a wide range of courses across the curriculum rather than for students who have narrowly focused on economics and math. Thus, it is not necessary for someone planning to go on in business or to an MBA program to have majored in economics. MBA programs normally expect that students have worked for a couple of years in business, government, or similar organization before they begin the MBA program. The appropriate coursework for these MBA programs is a wide range of liberal arts courses.</p>

			<h3>ECON 0250 Macroeconomic Theory (Fall 2022, Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Macroeconomic theory analyzes whether the market effectively coordinates individuals' decisions so that they lead to acceptable results. It considers the effectiveness of monetary, fiscal, and other policies in achieving desirable levels of unemployment, inflation, and growth. The theories held by various schools of economic thought such as Keynesians, monetarists, and new classicals are considered along with their proposed policies.

			<h3>ECON 0255 Microeconomic Theory (Fall 2022, Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Microeconomic theory concentrates on the study of the determination of relative prices and their importance in shaping the allocation of resources and the distribution of income in an economy. We will study the optimizing behavior of households in a variety of settings: buying goods and services, saving, and labor supply decisions. We will also examine the behavior of firms in different market structures. Together, the theories of household and firm behavior help illumine contemporary economic issues (discrimination in labor markets, mergers in the corporate world, positive and negative externalities, for example).

		<h1>Program in Education Studies</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><p>Through the investigation of educational theory, policy, research and practice from a variety of disciplinary perspectives students learn to think critically and creatively about the processes of teaching and learning and about the place of education in society. Effective fall 2017, Education Studies offers a double-major for those students who seek teacher licensure in either elementary (EDEL) or secondary (EDSL) education and a minor in general education (EDGW) for those who are interested in the field of education, but who do not seek teacher licensure. Students may not choose to major in Education Studies as a stand-alone major. The double major option is available only to those students seeking teacher licensure.</p>
<h2>Requirements for the Double Major in Teacher Licensure</h2>
<p>Students interested in earning a Vermont teaching license should meet with the Director of the Education Studies Program as soon as possible in their course of study. The four, state-required elements that must be satisfactorily completed in order to be recommended for Vermont initial educator licensure are: (i) Relevant coursework that satisfies the content requirements of the endorsement, (ii) Professional Semester, (iii) Vermont Licensure Portfolio, and (iv) state required examinations such as Praxis. The specific requirements for elementary and secondary teacher licensure are as follows:</p>

We will develop new understandings of current policy disputes regarding a broad range or educational issues by examining the familiar through different ideological and disciplinary lenses. 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>EDST 0210 Sophomore Seminar in the Liberal Arts (Fall 2022, Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The current pandemic, and all the questions it brings to the fore about what we value in a college experience, make this an ideal moment to consider the meaning and purpose of your liberal arts education. At the heart of this exploration will be a question posed by physicist Arthur Zajonc: “How do we find our own authentic way to an undivided life where meaning and purpose are tightly interwoven with intellect and action, where compassion and care are infused with insight and knowledge?” We will examine how, at this pivotal moment of decision making, you can understand your college career as an act of “cultivating humanity” and how you can meaningfully challenge yourself to take ownership of your intellectual and personal development. Through interdisciplinary and multicultural exploration, drawing from education studies and philosophical, religious, and literary texts, we will engage our course questions by way of student-led discussion, written reflection, and personal, experiential learning practices. In this way we will examine how a liberal arts education might foster the cultivation of an ‘undivided’ life, “the good life”, a life well-lived. (The course is open to sophomores and second semester first-year students. Juniors by permission only.)</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>EDST 0213 Understanding Educational Testing (Fall 2022, Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Achievement testing is now a cornerstone of education policy. It is also complex and routinely misunderstood by educators, policymakers, and the media.  In this course students will use statistical methods to explore and address testing issues that arise in both policy and practice. We will examine the uses and abuses of educational assessment. We will examine and interrogate trends and group differences in achievement. And we will broaden our understanding of essential concepts of measurement, such as reliability, validity, and bias, by analyzing both large and small datasets. Prior experience with the statistical package “R” is not required, as learning this package will be part of the course. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>EDST 0215 Culturally Relevant and Sustaining Pedagogies (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Gloria Ladson-Billings’ foundation work on culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) rests on these core propositions—students must experience academic success; students must gain cultural competence in relation to their own culture and at least one other culture; and students must develop a critical consciousness. In this class we will examine CRP and other liberatory pedagogies such as <em>Culturally Sustaining</em> (Paris, 2012); <em>Reality Pedagogy</em> (Emdin, 2016), <em>Abolitionist Teaching</em> (Love, 2019) each of which “seek to open up possibilities,” so that students can bring their “whole self into the classroom and into the world.” (Ladson-Billings, 2021).

			<h3>EDST 0300 Models of Inclusive Education (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In K-12 education, the term "inclusion" is often reduced to where students with apparent disabilities learn within schools. In this course, we will challenge the segregation of students with disabilities in schools while expanding notions of inclusion such that students' multiple identities are incorporated into learning. Students will be introduced and provided opportunities to design lessons using a Universal Design for Learning framework. We will utilize DisCrit (Disability Studies and Critical Race Theory) as a theoretical tool to explore how ableism and racism stand in the way of equitable education for many students while exploring theories, methods, and approaches to disrupt such marginalization and lead to inclusive antiracist educational practices.

			<span class="course_description">In this course, we examine what it means to be literate in the 21st century and ways in which all students can be empowered by the texts and teaching they encounter in schools. Students will develop their ability to enact literacy instruction based on current research about how children learn to read and write. We will take a critical look at texts—fiction, nonfiction, and historical—to consider the ways that texts read and write the world, develop abilities to select texts that empower all learners, and analyze retellings of historical events/persons to take into account multiple perspectives.  Many class sessions occur onsite at a local elementary school to provide consistent practice and supportive feedback on authentic components of teaching (transportation provided). In addition to class sessions, students will complete field experiences in a K-6 classroom in the Middlebury area to see the workings of an entire class. 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

		<h1>Department of English &amp; American Literatures</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><p>Students majoring in English may choose the <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/english/requirements#literature-track">Literature Track</a> or the <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/english/requirements#creative-writing-track">Creative Writing Track</a>.</p>
<h2>Literature Track</h2>
<p>Students who choose the Literature Track will take a total of 11 classes in the ENGL department (transfer credits from other institutions must be approved), as follows:</p>
<ul><li>ENGL 103 or CMLT 101</li>
<li>ENGL 205</li>
<li>Eight Electives:
<ul><li><em>At least </em>TWO of which must be courses carrying the <strong>REC</strong> (Race, Empire, and Colonialism) tag. Courses fulfilling the REC requirement engage students in the study of black diasporic and African American, Asian diasporic and Asian American, Latinx, indigenous and Native American, and postcolonial literatures. Courses <em>focusing on literature</em> in the Black Studies Department (BLST) can, with the approval of your advisor, count toward ENGL major requirements as REC courses or electives. ENGL majors are strongly encouraged to include at least one BLST course among their major requirements.</li>
<li><em>At least</em> TWO of which must be courses carrying the <strong>Pre-1800</strong> tag. Courses fulfilling the Pre-1800 requirement include courses in Medieval, Early Modern, and 18<sup>th</sup>-century literature. Only one Pre-1800 course may be a course on Shakespeare. </li>
<li>ONE of which <em>may</em> be a Creative Writing workshop</li>
</ul></li>
<li>One Advanced Seminar (all 400-level ENGL courses are Advanced Seminars)</li>
<li>Optional Senior Thesis (required for students seeking to graduate with Honors, and strongly recommended for those students interested in graduate work in English or related fields)</li>
</ul><p>These requirements are intended to offer students broad and historically grounded training in the discipline as well as a range of different pathways through the major. Students should confer closely with their advisers concerning their choices of electives.</p>
<h3>Requirements for the Joint Major</h3>
<p>A joint major in English with a Literature focus requires a minimum of <strong>eight</strong> ENGL courses, including three required courses: 1) ENGL 0103 or CMLT 0101; 2) ENGL 0205; 3) a joint thesis or other project that integrates both parts of the joint major. In addition, students will choose at least <strong>five</strong> electives from the available offerings, making sure that these courses satisfy the following requirements (one elective may be a CRWR course):</p>
<ul><li>One ENGL course bearing the REC tag (see major requirements for description)</li>
<li>One ENGL course bearing the Pre-1800 tag (see major requirements for description)</li>
<li>Advanced Seminar (400-level ENGL course)</li>
</ul><h3>Requirements for the Minor</h3>
<p>Students minoring in English with a Literature focus will take a minimum of six courses, including 1) ENGL 0103 or CMLT 010; 2) ENGL 205; 3) one ENGL elective bearing the REC tag; 4) one ENGL elective bearing the Pre-1800 tag; 5) one 400-level Advanced Seminar; and 6) one additional elective, which may be a CRWR course. A single course may fulfill more than one distribution requirement. See Major Requirements, above, for more description of these course requirements.</p>
<h2>Creative Writing Track</h2>
<p>Students who choose the Creative Writing Track will take a total of 11 classes, as follows:</p>
<ul><li>ENGL 103 or CMLT101</li>
<li>ENGL 205</li>
<li>Three CRWR Writing Workshops, at least ONE of which must be at the 300 level</li>
<li>Five Electives:
<ul><li><em>at least</em> ONE of which must be a course carrying the <strong>REC</strong> (Race, Empire, and Colonialism) tag. Courses fulfilling the REC requirement engage students in the study of black diasporic and African American, Asian diasporic and Asian American, Latinx, indigenous and Native American, and postcolonial literatures. Courses <em>focusing on literature</em> in the Black Studies Department (BLST) can, with the approval of your advisor, count toward ENGL major requirements as REC courses or electives. ENGL majors are strongly encouraged to include at least one BLST course among their major requirements.</li>
<li><em>at least</em> ONE of which must be a course carrying the <strong>Pre-1800</strong> tag. Courses fulfilling the Pre-1800 requirement include courses in Medieval, Early Modern, and 18<sup>th</sup>-century literature.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Advanced Seminar (all 400-level ENGL courses are Advanced Seminars)</li>
<li>Optional Senior Thesis (required for students seeking to graduate with Honors, and strongly recommended for those students interested in pursuing graduate work in writing-intensive fields)</li>
</ul><h3>Requirements for the Joint Major</h3>
<p>A joint major in English with a Creative Writing focus requires a minimum of <strong>nine</strong> courses, including 1) ENGL or CMLT101; 2) ENGL 205; 3) a 100-level CRWR course; 4) two 300-level CRWR courses; 5) an ENGL course bearing the REC tag; 6) an ENGL course bearing the Pre-1800 tag; 7) a 400-level ENGL Advanced Seminar; and 8) a Senior Thesis or Independent Project that integrates both parts of the joint major. See Major Requirements, above, for more description of these course requirements.</p>
<p> *Students wishing to undertake a joint major in ENGL (either track) and Theatre should be advised that senior work will normally consist of two full-credit classes, ENGL 0708 and THEA 0708. We strongly recommend that these classes be taken in the same semester, with the understanding that a central goal of the joint major is the thorough integration of both aspects of the joint major. A single-credit, single-semester joint project remains an option for those who wish to pursue a joint thesis that does not include a practical component such as acting or directing.</p>
<p>*Students wishing to undertake a joint major (either track) in ENGL and Film and Media Culture (FMMC) should follow the joint major requirements listed above.  Such students may also wish to take FMMC electives such as FMMC 0257 – Storytelling in Film and Media and FMMC 0279 – Film and Literature. Students on the Creative Track wishing to write a screenplay for their joint thesis must take specifically FMMC/CRWR 0106 – Writing for the Screen and FMMC/CRWR 0341 – Writing for the Screen II—prior to beginning the thesis. </p>
<p>*Students writing a joint thesis (either track) with HIST or HARC should register for HIST 0700 and 0711 or HARC 0710 and 0711.</p>
<h3>Requirements for the Minor</h3>
<p>Students minoring in English with a Creative Writing focus will take a minimum of six courses, including 1) ENGL 103 or CMLT101; 2) ENGL 205; 3) one CRWR 100-level course; 4) one CRWR 300-level course; 5) one 400-level Advanced Seminar; and 6) one additional elective, which may be ENGL or CRWR. See Major Requirements, above, for more description of these course requirements.</p>
<h2>Senior Program</h2>
<p>The ENGL senior program consists of an optional one-semester creative or critical Honors Thesis of 30-35 pages in length (ENGL 0700, CRWR 0701). CRWR 0701 requires the prior completion of one 0100-level CRWR workshop and two 0300-level CRWR workshops and a grade of at least B+ in both 0300-level courses before undertaking a thesis. All students will participate in an oral defense of their work with the adviser and additional readers (ideally two) of the project. Additional readers may be other ENGL/CRWR faculty, faculty outside the department, or interested scholars or writers from outside the college. Students are encouraged to complete their Advanced Seminar requirement before embarking on their senior work. Students must have a minimum 3.5 GPA in ENGL courses to be eligible to write an Senior Thesis</p>
<h2>Honors</h2>
<p>Departmental honors will be awarded to those students who achieve a departmental GPA of 3.85 and who complete an Senior Thesis (ENGL 0700 or CRWR 0701) in the fall or spring of the senior year. Completing a Thesis does not guarantee a student will receive honors. (See the ENGL website for more information on the Honors Thesis guidelines.) In determining the numerical average of course grades, all courses designated ENGL or CRWR will be counted, as will all other courses that fulfill requirements for the major (including those taken abroad or at other institutions). Joint majors are eligible to receive honors.  In determining joint honors, all courses that fulfill requirements for both majors will be counted.</p>

			<h3>CRWR 0454 Poetry Games: Experimental Poetics and Avant-Garde Aesthetics (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Not all poetry is, as William Wordsworth put it, “the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings.” Some poetry challenges the very nature of language, art, and subjectivity through various self-decentering forms of writing. In this course, we will study a century’s worth of avant-garde experimental poetry, from the Dadaists and Surrealists to the Oulipo group, the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets, and the conceptual and post-conceptual poetry movements of the 21st century, then create our own poetry using the same techniques and principles. The course is thus part survey and part writing workshop, with an emphasis on artistic process, linguistic theory, and the liberating power of constraints. Topics include: aleatory poetry, algorithmic poetry, blackout poetry, concrete poetry, erasure poetry, exquisite corpse, found poetry, homophonic translation, sound poetry, lipograms, S+7, etc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

This course is designed to develop techniques for reading and writing about literary works through the lens of our chosen theme: the transformation of identities (in terms of race, class, gender, etc.) in literary works. We will read a range of plays, poetry, fiction, and creative non-fiction across temporal and natural boundaries, exploring the different critical methods and interpretive tools available to us. Both the thematic and skill-building arcs of the course will culminate in a reading of Toni Morrison’s novel The Song of Solomon in the context of several different--and sometimes contradictory--critical and theoretical approaches.

In this gateway course to the major, students will also develop skills in reading, writing, and critical analysis crucial to further study in the field. Readings will trespass conventional historical and national boundaries, moving from canonical Anglo American poetry to a vibrant sampling of multi-ethnic American and postcolonial writing. Topics explored include the industrialization of food production, climate change, gardening, species-extinction, capitalist enclosure, agricultural work and workers, flowers, and dolphins. 3 hrs. lect./disc</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

If every work of literature takes us to some “far country” of a world partly real and partly imagined, this course will be a “grand tour” of far-flung destinations, some tranquil, some desperately at war; some of which prompt us to look inward, some of which challenge us to act forcefully in the world at large. Our sustained concern, apart from learning how to appreciate a wide variety of styles, techniques, and genres, will be to acquire the analytical and writing skills that will allow students to convincingly communicate their feelings and insights about literature to others. To accomplish this, we will closely read selected works from Shakespeare to the present, become familiar with a lexicon of helpful literary terms, and introduce ourselves to some basics of literary theory. 3 hrs. lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Writers have always been concerned with the meaning of place and the passage of time, and our task will be to explore the diverse ways that literature in English expresses, grapples with, and comes to terms with these fundamental concepts. Of central concern will be the relationship between form and content in literary expression. Along the way, you will learn to more fluently read, write about, and talk about multiple literary genres—poetry, drama, short fiction, and novel—from Shakespeare to the 21st century. 3 hrs. lect./disc</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

					<span class="course_description"><strong>Reading Literature: How to Do Things with Words</strong><br>
How does language make and unmake the world around us? Is literature capable of intervening in the social and historical conditions of its own making? How does literary criticism participate in cultural transformation? To get a grasp on these questions, we will read widely in literature that explores the relationships between language, power, and social life, as well as criticism and theory that examines the interactions between aesthetics and politics. Our inquiry will survey the practical and theoretical foundations of literary study, as well as current debates about methodology in the field. Readings might include: Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, and poetry by Phillis Wheatley Peters, John Keats, Dionne Brand, Solmaz Sharif, and M.

			<h3>ENGL 0108 Animals in Literature and Culture (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Animals, wrote anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, are good to think with. They are good to write with as well; almost all works of literature include animals, their importance varying from the merely peripheral to the absolutely central.  Among other narrative functions, animals serve as essential metaphors for understanding the human animal. In this course we will read a wide variety of fiction, poetry, children's literature, philosophy, science, history, and cultural theory from Ancient Greek sources (in translation) to the present. We will consider theoretical, ethical, religious, psychological, linguistic, and political issues pertaining to animals and their representation in literary texts. lect./disc.

			<h3>ENGL 0109 Literary “Character” (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will investigate literary character—what it is; what makes it “round,” “flat,” “deep,” “shallow”; its history.  In seeking to understand “character,” we will create our own stories, using characters from our readings, or introducing characters we create into plots or settings from those readings.  In expository essays and class discussions, we will also consider the following questions: how and why did “fictional person” acquire the name “character” (literally “engraved mark”)?  How does “character” relate to representations of body, property, authorship, gender, race? How does theatrical character relate to novelistic and short-story character? Possible authors: Aristotle, Theophrastus, Terence, Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, Laurence Sterne, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Herman Melville, Mark Twain, Virginia Woolf, Richard Wright, Julia Alvarez. 3 hrs. lect.

			<span class="course_description">From boba to K-pop, Asian diasporic culture is undeniably the shared lexicon of a global mainstream. In this course, we will engage with recent literary, televisual, and cinematic works to discern what they express about Asian American history, identity, and cultural politics. What is the difference between appropriation and authenticity? What can “popular” representations tell us about “serious” topics such as capitalism, citizenship, and empire? How does Asian American popular culture enact collective desires for belonging and memory? In particular, we will attend to the gendered and sexual circuits of cultural formation, with units on Asian American girlhood and queer diasporas. Texts include: <em>Flower Drum Song</em>, <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em>, and <em>Master of None</em>. Authors may include: Ocean Vuong and Lysley Tenorio.

How is race constituted and what role does literature play in the process? How are cultural representations of racialized difference formed in relation to its historical, material, and social conditions? We will critically analyze the nested issues of labour, law, and migration that have shaped Black, Indigenous, and Asian presence within North America. From there, we explore the themes of assimilation, multiculturalism, diaspora, and American empire in order to track the trajectory of minoritarian literature throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Authors may include: Maxine Hong Kingston, Tomson Highway, Toni Morrison, and Viet Nguyen. 3 hrs. lect./disc. (REC). (Formerly ENAM 0115)</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ENGL 0123 Adventures in Literary Romance (Pre-1800) (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will explore the literary genre of romance.  Today, “romance” often refers to courtship—only one aspect of this ancient genre.  Other aspects include adventure, magic, wonder, multiple plots, multiple authors, an affinity for sequels.  Romance’s associations with every genre—tragedy, comedy, epic, novel, lyric poetry—and its reputation for escapism have made it an epitome of the very idea of literature, as conceived by attackers and defenders.  Its welcoming of female readers and protagonists and its marketing of the exotic have raised issues of gender and ethnicity.  We will discuss all such aspects and implications of romance, and we may also explore how romance has shaped modern television and film. No papers or exams; there will be quizzes <em>daily</em> on the reading, and students will be expected to participate thoughtfully in class discussions.  Readings from texts such as: <em>Daphnis and Chloe</em>, <em>Ethiopian Romance</em>, The Gospel of Luke, <em>The Golden Ass</em>, Arthurian romances by various authors, <em>Orlando Inamorato</em>, <em>Orlando Furioso</em>, <em>The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia</em>, <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, <em>The Winter’s Tale</em>, <em>Don Quixote</em>,/ Waverly/, <em>Madame Bovary</em>, <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>, and <em>The Time Quintet</em>. 3 hrs. lect.

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will introduce several major schools of contemporary literary theory. By reading theoretical texts in close conjunction with works of literature, we will illuminate the ways in which these theoretical stances can produce multiple interpretations of a given literary work. The approaches covered may include New Criticism, Psychoanalysis, Marxism and Cultural Criticism, Race Theory and Multicultural Criticism, Feminism, Post-Colonial Criticism, Queer Studies, Eco-Criticism, Post-Structuralism, and others. These theories will be applied to various works of fiction, poetry, and drama. The goal will be to make students critically aware of the fundamental literary, cultural, political, and moral assumptions underlying every act of interpretation they perform.  3 hrs. lect/disc.

In this course we will explore how writers and thinkers grappled with these economic, social, and political transformations at the levels of narrative, form, and genre by reading novels, plays, poems, and essays by Aphra Behn, Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, Susanna Centlivre, Laurence Sterne, Olaudah Equiano, and others. 3 hrs. lect./disc.(Formerly ENAM 0225)</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Beginning with Sophocles’s tragedy <em>Women of Trachis</em>, we will explore the classical representation of acute pain in the context of early Greek medicine, before examining medieval and early modern literary works inspired by the Black Death, including selections from Boccaccio’s <em>Decameron</em>. The second half of the class will focus on modernist and contemporary accounts of illness, including Virginia Woolf’s treatment of both the 1918 influenza epidemic and so-called “shell-shock” in her novel <em>Mrs Dalloway</em>. We will intersperse our literary readings with theoretical explorations of cure, disability, and ableism by writers such as Eli Clare, as well as work from the emerging field of narrative medicine. 3 hrs. lect.(Formerly ENAM 0242)</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

We will place literary representations of human rights violations (genocide, torture, detention and forced labor, environmental devastation, police violence) in dialogue with official human rights treaties and declarations in order to historicize and critique the assumptions of human rights discourse. Who qualifies as a “human” deserving of humanitarian intervention? How do human rights rehearse a colonial dynamic based on racial and geo-political privilege? To answer these questions we will turn to some of the most controversial voices in global fiction and poetry. 3 hrs. lect. (not open to students who have taken ENAM 0230)<br>

			<h3>ENGL 0250 The Romantic Revolution (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">he generation of British poets and novelists known collectively as the Romantics decisively rebelled against earlier conceptions of what literature could speak about, how it could best describe a rapidly changing world, and who was fit to be its reader.  Arguably the first environmentalists, the Romantics also initiated our modern discussions of gender, class, race, and nationalism.  To encounter the Romantics is to witness intellectual courage taking up arms against habit, prejudice, and tyranny.  We will trace their genius and daring (and follow their personal attachments for, and rivalries with, each other) through the poetry of Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, and Keats, and the novels of Mary Shelley and Emily Brönte. 3 hrs. lect./disc.

			<span class="course_description">Time travel, aliens, androids, robots, corporate and political domination, reimaginings of race, gender, sexuality and the human body--these concerns have dominated science fiction over the last 150 years.  But for all of its interest in the future, science fiction tends to focus on technologies and social problems relevant to the period in which it is written. In this course, we'll work to understand both the way that authors imagine technology's role in society and how those imaginings create meanings for science and its objects of study and transformation.  Some likely reading and films include Mary Shelley, Frankenstein, H. G. Wells, The Island of Doctor Moreau, Ridley Scott, Blade Runner, and works by William Gibson, Ursula LeGuin, Octavia Butler and other contemporary writers.

How do pathological protagonists drive readers toward the precariousness of their own physical and mental health?  The readings for this class center on the provisional nature of sanity and the challenges to bodily health in a world of modern commerce, media, and medical diagnoses.  We will begin with 19th century texts and their engagement with seemingly "diseased" responses to urbanization, new forms of work, and new structures of the family and end with contemporary fictional psychopaths engaged in attacks on the world of images we inhabit in the present.  Nineteenth century texts will likely include stories by Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman.  Later  20th-century works will likely include Ken Kesey, <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</em>, Thomas Harris, <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>, Susanna Kaysen, <em>Girl, Interrupted</em>, and Bret Easton Ellis, <em>American Psycho</em>.

While realism was an effort to describe “life as it is” and regionalism focused on the distinctive features of specific places, both modes of representation stemmed from historical forces that were reshaping the nation. Works to be covered may include fiction by William Dean Howells, Charles Chesnutt, Sarah Orne Jewett, Kate Chopin, and Theodore Dreiser. 3 hrs. lect.

But the increasing power of medicine has also raised nightmarish possibilities of lives controlled, squandered, or sacrificed to a system that often alienates patients, is centered on profit, and has a long history of treating marginal populations recklessly. How do science fiction writers, doctors, film makers, memoirists, and healthcare corporations portray an ever more medicalized vision of human experience and human bodies? Texts and films for the course will include HG Wells, <em>The Island of Doctor Moreau</em>, Atul Gawande, <em>Complications</em>; Octavia Butler, Clay’s <em>Ark</em>; Michael Gondry, <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, Karen Russell, <em>Sleep Donation</em>, and Kazuo Ishiguro, <em>Never Let Me Go</em>.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ENGL 0291 Portraits of the Lady: The New Woman in American Literature &amp; Culture (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">At the end of the 19th century, women fought against restrictions limiting their sphere of influence. As they sought to exercise more control over their lives personally, socially, and economically, this “New Woman,”  and the way she was changing the face of society, became a popular subject in literature and art.  In this course we will consider portraits of women by well-known American authors (such as James, Chopin, Wharton, Sui Sin Far, Cather, Larsen, Hurston) alongside those by prominent painters, sculptors, photographers, illustrators, and filmmakers.  We will consider how representations of women through the early twentieth century embodied the values of the nation and codified both the fears and aspirations of its citizens. 3 hrs. lect.

We will also think about how landmark examples have shaped the form.  Working with software designed for the purpose, students will use photographs to produce short comics of their own.

We will study both the continuities and divergences in contemporary Black, Indigenous, and Asian American literary productions from their historical iterations. What shifts have taken place in the multi-ethnic literary canon and tradition between the past to current centuries? We will engage with themes such as the rise of genre fiction, changes to the literary marketplace, and the status of “national literature” in the global age.

In this course we will explore the imaginative aspects of classical economic thought and the economically descriptive capacities of literature. We will track their common interests in concepts of belief, credibility, and abstraction by looking (primarily) at a period that witnessed the emergence of political economy and modern literary forms like the novel—the eighteenth century. Along the way, we will hazard answers to the following question: in an age of rampant inequality and financialization, what can we learn from representations of historical crises, bubbles, and class struggles? 3 hrs. sem</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ENGL 0312 Modern Poetry (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">This course will examine the nature and achievement of the major modern poets of Britain and America during the modern period, beginning with the origins of poetic modernism in the work of Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, and Walt Whitman. The central figures to be studied are William Butler Yeats, T.S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, and W.H. Auden. The course will conclude with a look at some after-echoes of modernism in the work of Elizabeth Bishop and others.

			<h3>ENGL 0316 Poetry and the Spiritual Tradition (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will examine the long and intimate connection between poetry and spirituality, looking especially at the influence of Christian thinking on such English and American poets as John Donne, George Herbert, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and T.S. Eliot. The course will begin with a study of the King James Version of the Book of Psalms, which deeply affected later British and American poetry. We will also read early Taoist and Islamic poets, including Lao Tse and Rumi. The course will conclude with a look at the work of several contemporary poets: Charles Wright, Louis Glück, and Mary Oliver. While this course is primarily online, on-campus students will have opportunities to meet in person with fellow students and the professor in small groups and during office hours, if circumstances allow. Off-campus students will be accommodated with additional optional online opportunities to connect. 3 hrs. lct. (Formerly ENAM 0316)</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ENGL 0320 Indigenous and Settler Colonial Fictions (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The term “settler colonialism” has gained currency recently as a way of describing the unjust displacement of indigenous peoples, the theft of their lands and resources, and the negation of native epistemologies, cultures, and histories. This course foregrounds indigenous literary voices that challenge and present alternatives to settler colonial narratives. Students will adopt a comparative approach that identifies continuities and disparities between Native American/First Nations, Mexican, Pacific Islander, South African, Palestinian, Maori, and Hawaiian depictions of indigeneity. Authors will include Haunani-Kay Trask, Leslie Marmon Silko, Oscar Zeta Acosta, Craig Santos Perez, Joy Harjo, Maxine Hong Kingston, Rigoberta Menchu, Keri Hulme, Joe Sacco, and J.M Coetzee.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ENGL 0330 Shakespeare’s Career (Pre-1800) (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will study the whole arc of William Shakespeare's literary career from the earliest histories, comedies, and non-dramatic poetry to the more mature tragedies and romances, with an eye to understanding Shakespeare’s development as a writer in his own time. How might the plays have resonated for his first audiences on stage, and how have subsequent readers drawn their own meanings from the published texts? Reading one play a week, we will pay close attention to such dramaturgical issues as Shakespeare’s construction of character and of plot, his adaptation of sources, and his modes of versification, as well as the ethical, political, and commercial implications of Shakespeare’s works during his lifetime, some of which stand in contrast with what we learn from them today. Weather permitting, some meetings may be held outside in person. 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc./3 hrs. screen. (Formerly ENAM 0330)</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ENGL 0354 Postcolonial Literature, Migrants and the City (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course, we will analyze postcolonial literature that portrays the lives of migrants in cities. Postcolonial novels such as <em>Brick Lane</em> by Monica Ali, <em>Love Enough</em> by Dionne Brand, <em>Brother</em> by David Chariandi, <em>The Inheritance of Loss</em> by Kiran Desai, <em>Carnival</em> by Rawi Hage, <em>The Lonely Londoners</em> by Sam Selvon and <em>A Free Man</em> by Aman Sethi present counter-hegemonic narratives and visions of the city. They show that the city, indelibly marked by relations of Empire and the product of racial capitalism, is also a battleground for decoloniality: a delinking from colonial knowledge practices. To map this insurgent knowledge in postcolonial novels of the city, we will focus on four prominent themes that also serve as analytical categories: mobility, labor, conviviality, and protest.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

We will work chronologically and across genres to understand how and by whom the written word was deployed in pursuit of physical and mental freedom and racial and socioeconomic justice. As the course progresses, we will deepen our study of historical context drawing on the substantial resources of Middlebury's special collections, students will have the opportunity to engage in archival work if they wish.  Authors will include Emerson, Douglass, Jacobs, Thoreau, Stowe, Walker, and Garrison. 3 hrs. sem. (Diversity) (Rec) (Formerly ENAM 0358)</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ENGL 0419 Gender, Power, and Politics on the Early Modern Stage (I) (Pre-1800) (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this class we will explore the representation of gendered embodiment on the early modern stage, considering as we do so how theatrical embodiment intersects with other treatments of the body in early modern culture.  We will read both early modern and contemporary theoretical accounts of gender as performance, investigating among other issues the use of boy actors, the representation of specifically “female” disorders (e.g., “suffocation” or hysteria), the performance of maternity, and the treatment of same-sex eroticism. Of particular importance will be the representation of the articulate or angry woman as the “shrew” or “scold,” and we will begin the class with an investigation of so-called “shrew-taming” narratives. Primary readings will include: Shakespeare’s <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> and <em>The Winter’s Tale</em>, Webster’s <em>Duchess of Malfi</em>, and Cavendish’s <em>Convent of Pleasure</em>. We will end the semester with a look at how this material plays out in our current political moment, focusing in particular on the representation of Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, and Christine Blasey Ford. 3 hrs. sem.

			<h3>ENGL 0451 The Novels of J.M. Coetzee: Ethics and Empire (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Coetzee, whose novels engage questions of institutional racism, state-sponsored violence, patriarchal privilege, environmental degradation, animal rights, and how to ethically approach cultural Others, manages to speak of specific historical circumstances—such as South Africa’s apartheid regime—while simultaneously addressing universal dilemmas of our contemporary human condition.  Having received both the Booker (twice) and Nobel Prizes for literature, Coetzee is recognized as the living heir of both Kafka and Beckett, and as a writer whose searing prose and formal experimentation both extend and transform the novel’s traditional role as our culture’s most skeptical self-inquisitor.  Depicting every act of writing as either a confrontation or an evasion, Coetzee both reveres and rebukes the literary traditions he warily embraces.  We will read his strongest and most globally recognized works, from <em>Waiting for the Barbarians</em> through <em>Disgrace</em>.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ENGL 0454 Poetry Games: Experimental Poetics and Avant-Garde Aesthetics (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Not all poetry is, as William Wordsworth put it, “the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings.” Some poetry challenges the very nature of language, art, and subjectivity through various self-decentering forms of writing. In this course, we will study a century’s worth of avant-garde experimental poetry, from the Dadaists and Surrealists to the Oulipo group, the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets, and the conceptual and post-conceptual poetry movements of the 21st century, then create our own poetry using the same techniques and principles. The course is thus part survey and part writing workshop, with an emphasis on artistic process, linguistic theory, and the liberating power of constraints. Topics include: aleatory poetry, algorithmic poetry, blackout poetry, concrete poetry, erasure poetry, exquisite corpse, found poetry, homophonic translation, sound poetry, lipograms, S+7, etc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ENGL 0458 The Graphic Novel (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will study some of the most widely respected graphic novels produced in the last thirty years. Our purpose will be to understand how the form works and is structured by its dual, but sometimes competing, interests in the verbal and the visual, and to think about distinct styles of illustration.  We will also think about how landmark examples have shaped the form.  Working with software designed for the purpose, students will use photographs to produce short comics of their own.  Possible texts include: Alan Moore, <em>Watchmen</em>; Art Spiegelman, <em>Maus</em>; Chris Ware, <em>Jimmy Corrigan</em>; Alison Bechdel, <em>Fun Home</em>. 3 hrs. lect.

			<span class="course_description">Scholars have recently uncovered a rich history of black and Asian solidarity against racism. Yet the Los Angeles uprisings of 1992 provided a painful reminder of the antagonisms between black and Asian diasporic groups. This course will explore how Asian American and African American identities have historically been constructed in relation to one another. We will foreground key sites in the making and undermining of Afro-Asian intimacies, from the racial formation of coolie laborers to the cross-racial imagination of Kung-Fu and Hip Hop. Authors will include Richard Wright, Chang-Rae Lee, Vijay Prashad, Frank Chin, Das Racist, Mira Nair, and W.E.B. Dubois.  3 hrs. sem.

		<h1>Program in Environmental Studies</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><p><em>Students matriculating<strong> Fall 2018 or later</strong> must follow these requirements. Students matriculated <strong>prior to Fall 2018</strong> have the option to follow these requirement or the <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/environmental-studies/requirements/previous-requirements">previous requirements</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Major in Environmental Studies</h2>
<p>The environmental studies major is composed of course work in four areas: four environmental studies <strong>core courses</strong>; 7-8 courses in a <strong>focus area</strong>; two environmental <strong>cognate courses</strong>; and an <strong>integrative capstone experience</strong>. Except for transfer students, the core courses and capstone experience must be Middlebury College courses, which for the purposes of the Environmental Studies major are defined as those offered by the undergraduate college during fall, winter, spring, and summer terms. The student’s advisor must approve any non-Middlebury College courses within the focus area; the ES Director must approve any non-Middlebury College courses within the rest of the major. A maximum of three non-Middlebury College courses may be credited toward completion of the major.</p>
<p><strong>I. Core Course Requirements</strong></p>
<p>All majors are required to complete four core courses, ENVS 0112, ENVS 0211, ENVS 0215, and <em>one</em> spatial analysis course, chosen in consultation with your advisor, from among the following: ENVS/GEOG 0120, ENVS/GEOG 0150, or ENVS/GEOG 231.</p>
<p>ENVS 0112 should be completed by the end of the sophomore year; all core courses must be completed by the end of the junior year. Only those students who have completed the core courses are eligible to enroll in advanced integrative work.</p>
<p><strong>II. Focus Course Requirements</strong><br>
Majors must complete the 7-8 course requirements for one of 17 established foci. Foci fall into one of four academic divisions: arts, humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences. These divisions govern which cognate courses a student may take. Courses taken within the focus that are not specified must be approved by the <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/environmental-studies/requirements/advisors-es-foci">student’s advisor</a>, who must come from the student’s focus. As indicated, some foci automatically qualify the student for joint major status. Environmental Studies foci are as follows (specific requirements for each can be found further below):</p>
<p><strong>Arts Foci:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Environmental Dance</li>
<li>Environmental Studies-Architecture joint major</li>
<li>Environmental Studio Art</li>
<li>Environmental Theatre</li>
</ul><p><strong>Humanities Foci</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>Environmental History</li>
<li>Environmental Literature</li>
<li>Environmental Writing</li>
<li>Religion, Philosophy and the Environment</li>
</ul><p><strong>Natural Science Foci</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>Conservation Biology (Environmental Studies-Biology joint major)</li>
<li>Environmental Studies-Chemistry joint major</li>
<li>Environmental Earth and Climate Sciences joint major</li>
</ul><p><strong>Social Science Foci</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>Conservation Psychology</li>
<li>Environmental Economics</li>
<li>Environmental Justice</li>
<li>Environmental Policy</li>
<li>Environmental Studies-Anthropology joint major</li>
<li>Environmental Studies-Geography joint major</li>
</ul><p><strong>III. Cognate Course Requirements</strong><br>
Two cognate courses must be selected from the <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/environmental-studies/requirements/approved-cognates">approved list of cognates</a>, subject to the following:</p>
<ul><li>cognates must represent an academic division outside the division of the student’s chosen focus (see academic division for each focus above (section II));</li>
<li>for students focusing outside the natural sciences, at least one cognate must be an approved natural science cognate <em>with a laboratory (this course should be completed by the end of junior year).</em></li>
<li>one cognate may be integrative (representing two or more academic divisions).</li>
</ul><p>Because integrative courses represent more than one academic division, they inherently represent an academic division outside the division of the student’s focus; therefore, all integrative courses can be counted by all majors toward completion of the cognate requirement, subject to the rules above. Not all approved cognates are offered each semester. Please check with relevant departments regarding course offerings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. Advanced Integrative Capstone Requirement</strong><br>
After completing the required core courses, majors must complete the community-engaged environmental studies practicum ENVS 0401, open to juniors and seniors.</p>
<h3>Senior Work in Environmental Studies</h3>
<p>All seniors are required to take ENVS 0401, the ENVS senior seminar devoted to community-connected learning and requiring significant interdisciplinary work. ENVS does not universally require senior independent work; however, some foci within ENVS do.</p>
<p>Majors who are not required to complete independent senior work in their focus may, in consultation and approval of an advisor, apply to complete (optional) senior independent work in ENVS. Senior work in ENVS may be carried out as a one-term senior project (ENVS 0700) or as a multi-term senior thesis (ENVS 0700/0701).</p>
<p>All senior independent work carried out in ENVS or toward honors eligibility (i.e., carried out in a focus department) in Environmental Studies must be on a topic pertinent to the relationship between humans and environment; be supervised by at least one faculty advisor who is appointed in or affiliated with the environmental studies program; and must be presented publicly. In consultation with the thesis committee, students may present as part of the Spring Research Symposium or as a separate event arranged with the committee and ES Program.</p>
<p>For additional important details regarding the integrative capstone requirement and/or senior work options, please visit the <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/environmental-studies/requirements/senior-work">senior work</a> page.</p>
<h2>Minor in Environmental Studies</h2>
<p>The minor in environmental studies consists of five courses: three environmental studies core courses to be completed by the end of the sixth semester: ENVS 0112; ENVS or ENVS/PSCI 0211; and ENVS or ENVS/ENAM 0215; one course selected from among: ART 0348, DANC 0277, ECON 0265, ENAM 0227, ENVS 0209, ENVS 0210, ENVS 0230, ENVS 0385, ENVS 0395, HARC 0231, HIST 0222, PHIL 0356, PSCI 0214, PSYC 0233/0333; and one course from among: BIOL 0140, CHEM 0270, ENVS/GEOG 150, ECSC 0112, ECSC 0161, or ECSC 0323. Except for transfer students, the environmental studies core courses must be taken at Middlebury College. With the approval of the Environmental Studies program director, a maximum of one course taken off campus may be credited toward completion of other (e.g., non-core course) minor requirements.</p>
<h2>Joint Majors</h2>
<p>Environmental studies majors who focus in architecture, biology, chemistry, earth and climate sciences, geography, or anthropology automatically qualify as joint majors. Students may pursue a joint major between environmental studies and other majors. The other major usually overlaps the student’s focus and represents additional coursework in the focus. Students interested in completing such a “non-automatic” joint major should consult with the chair of their focus department about joint majors. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the environmental studies major, there is no reduction in course requirements for the environmental studies component of a joint major.</p>

<h2>Other Environmental Perspectives</h2>
<p>For students interested in studying the environment from perspectives for which there is not an established focus (e.g., international environmental studies, food studies), we recommend that students select the established focus that most closely meets their goals, select cognates that complement these goals, and, when possible, select topics on course assignments and projects that complement their goals and interests. Students are also encouraged to consider the possibility for intersecting study abroad opportunities with their goals and interests. Finally, students might consider completing a minor in environmental studies alongside a major of their choice. Students are encouraged to meet with the ES Director or with faculty advisors who advise for foci related to their interests to discuss their options.</p>
<h2>Environmental Studies Program Honors</h2>
<p>Program honors will be awarded to majors who complete a multi-term senior thesis on a topic pertinent to the relationship between humans and the environment and meet the following requirements: the thesis must be supervised by a faculty advisor who is appointed in or affiliated with the environmental studies program; the work must be presented publicly, orally defended before their committee, and be of superior quality (B+ or higher); the student must achieve an average GPA of B+ or higher in courses taken toward completion of the major. Courses counting toward the GPA in the major include core courses, courses taken in fulfillment of focus with the exception of senior thesis courses (i.e., 700-level courses are excluded), cognates, and ENVS 0401 (if taken). If extra cognates or courses within the focus were taken, those with the highest grades will be applied toward completion of the major and toward the GPA calculation for honors eligibility.</p>

			<h3>ENVS 0209 Gender Health Environment (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Growing concern for the protection of the environment and human health has led policy makers and scholars to consider ways in which gender, class, and race and other forms of identity mediate human-environment interactions.  In this course we will explore how access to, control over, and distribution of resources influence environmental and health outcomes both in terms of social inequities and ecological decline.  Specific issues we will cover include: ecofeminism, food security, population, gendered conservation, environmental toxins, climate change, food justice, and the green revolution.  We will draw comparisons between different societies around the globe as well as look at dynamics between individuals within a society.

			<span class="course_description">Throughout the history of the United States, Americans have created a complex set of meanings pertaining to the environments (wild, pastoral, urban, marine) in which they live.  From European-Native contact to the present, Americans’ various identities, cultures, and beliefs about the bio-physical world have shaped the stories they tell about “nature,” stories that sometimes share common ground, but often create conflicting and contested understandings of human-environment relationships.  In this course we will investigate these varied and contested stories from multi-disciplinary perspectives in the humanities—history, literature, and religion--and will include attention to race, class, gender, and environmental justice. 3 hrs. lect./disc.

Power dynamics, thoughtways, humans and planet Earth changed when our ancestors began annually disrupting soil ecosystems and storing surplus food. We explore notions of perennial thinking and action through readings, direct experience, and work with local partners at the forefront of the perennial turn. Combining ancient and contemporary knowledges in science, history, philosophy, spirituality, and more, we investigate thinking more like a prairie than a plow. How might we regrow deep roots and craft ways that align with current understandings of Universe, Earth, life? How might we support resilient, multi-generational, place-based learning, doing, being? 3 hrs. sem., 1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

		<h1>Department of Film &amp; Media Culture</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>Major Requirements</h2>
<p>Students must complete ten courses to satisfy the requirements for a major in Film and Media Culture. Before declaring a Film and Media Culture major, the student must have completed or be currently enrolled in one of the basic core courses. Those courses are as follows:</p>
<h2>Basic Core Course Requirements</h2>
<p>FMMC 0101 Aesthetics of the Moving Image; FMMC 0102 Film History; FMMC 0104 TV and American Culture; and one production course - either FMMC 0105 Sight and Sound or FMMC 0106 Writing for the Screen I. The basic core courses should be completed by the end of the junior year.</p>
<h2>Required Advanced Courses</h2>
<p>One 0300 level course in theory — FMMC 0354, FMMC 0355, FMMC/GSFS 0358, FMMC 0360, or another approved 0300 level course — typically to be completed during junior year; and FMMC 0700 Film and Media Senior Tutorial.</p>
<h2>Electives</h2>
<p>Four additional FMMC courses, with at least two of these being critical studies or history courses. With the prior permission of a student’s academic advisor, one winter term FMMC course may be counted as an elective. Independent study courses will typically not count as an elective unless approved by the department chair for exceptional circumstances. Students taking courses focused on film and media taught in a foreign language, either at Middlebury or abroad, may request major elective credit from their advisor. Note that courses may not count toward both FMMC and another department’s major or minor. Courses transferred from other institutions will <em>normally </em>count only as an elective toward the FMMC major, not to fulfill core requirements.</p>
<h2>Minor</h2>
<p>Three required courses - FMMC 0101 Aesthetics of the Moving Image, FMMC 0102 Film History, FMMC 0104 TV and American Culture. In addition, minors must take three additional courses that are listed or cross-listed as FMMC. At least one of the three electives must be at the 0300 or 0400-level. At least one of the three electives must be a critical studies or history course.</p>
<h2>Joint Major</h2>
<p>The joint major with FMMC is a combination of two disciplines, culminating in a joint senior project; the plan for joint majors is negotiated between the student and the two departments in which the joint program of study is pursued at the time of declaring the joint major. <strong>The senior project</strong> must combine aspects of both majors and in most cases will require approval, supervision, and evaluation from either departments or programs. The Film and Media Culture part of the joint major requires a minimum of seven courses, including four 100-level FMMC core courses, a 300-level theory course, FMMC 0700 Film and Media Senior Tutorial (or the equivalent senior project course in the other department), and any courses required or appropriate prior to undertaking the joint senior project. FMMC supports a concentration in American Studies, as detailed on its page.</p>
<h2>Joint Major with English</h2>
<p>A common joint major is ENAM/FMMC, combining an interest in storytelling in both literary and visual forms. Joint ENAM/FMMC majors are required to fulfill the basic Joint requirements for FMMC as listed above, and are encouraged to take the relevant electives FMMC 0257 Storytelling in Film and Media and FMMC 0279 Film and Literature if possible. Students who wish to write a screenplay for their joint senior project are required to take FMMC 0106 Writing for the Screen I and FMMC 0341 Writing for the Screen II; additionally, their screenwriting project must be tied to literary topics or issues (including adaptation).</p>
<h2>Honors</h2>
<p>The faculty of Film and Media Culture will award honors to select students based on their overall excellence in film and media coursework with a minimum GPA of 3.7, and on the merit of their senior project.</p>

			<h3>FMMC 0208 Contemporary East Asian Cinema (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will study the contemporary cinema cultures of East Asia, focusing predominantly on the production of China, Japan, and South Korea in the 21st century. We will examine production, distribution, and (global) consumption in order to understand how these industries fit into or transcend national, regional, and global cinema paradigms. We will consider issues of superstardom and authorship, especially the ways in which prominent auteurs adapt, develop, and (re)invent genres and aesthetic techniques. We will also examine some of the more complex cinematic representations of tradition and modernity, nationalism, race and ethnicity, and gender and sexuality. The broader goal of the course is to think how the region’s film production can be conceptualized in terms of national/regional/global cinema, so we will use a comparative approach by analyzing similarities and unique differences within the main national industries studied. 3 hrs. lect./disc.; 3 hrs. screening</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>FMMC 0252 Authorship &amp; Cinema: Hitchcock and Renoir (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Alfred Hitchcock and Jean Renoir are commonly regarded as two of the greatest filmmakers in history, yet their cinematic styles stand in sharp contrast to one another.  In this course, we will survey the careers of these two directors, viewing a representative selection of their films and considering the national production contexts in which they worked.  Most importantly, we will engage in careful analysis of their works in order to understand the ways in which their approaches to film style resulted in sharply contrasting ideas of cinema and the world.  Films screened will include: <em>The 39 Steps, Notorious, Rear Window, Vertigo, Psycho</em> (Hitchcock); <em>Toni, The Crime of Monsieur Lange, Grande Illusion, Rules of the Game</em> (Renoir).

But such a change means rethinking the rhetorical modes traditionally used in scholarly writing, and incorporating more aesthetic and poetic elements alongside explanation and analysis. In this hands-on course, we will both study and produce new videographic forms of criticism often known as “video essays,” exploring how such work can both produce knowledge and create an aesthetic impact.

How do we engage with media texts in local and global contexts? Is our experience of media today radically different from the early years of cinema? What does it mean to be a fan? Have our notions of fandom changed over time? How do race, gender, class, national, and cultural context inform media engagement? We will consider key theoretical approaches and interrogate our own position as spectators, consumers, and fans in  media culture.

How do we understand the boundaries between any film “text” and its broader intertextual contexts? How does authorship frame our understanding of the style and ethics of any given film? How do genre categories help us make sense of films and media, as well as their cultural contexts? How do films and media tell stories in distinctive and innovative ways? Through theoretical readings and exemplary screenings, we will learn to become sharper critics of films and media.

			<h3>FOOD 0209 History of US Food Politics (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will use U.S. food politics as a lens for understanding developments in political economy, changes in the role of the state, and evolving attitudes toward gender, race, labor, childhood, citizenship, health, and the body during the twentieth century. How have government, corporations, and scientists shaped U.S. foodways? How have people been affected by broad trends in food politics, and how have they resisted, as consumers, citizens, and activists? To answer these questions, we will use methods of social and cultural history to explore food politics from the top down and the bottom up. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>FOOD 0230 Food Security in Lebanon (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will begin with a short history of Lebanon’s agrarian to urban transition to look at its contemporary food system, asking such questions as: Who profits from the food system? How viable is agriculture in Lebanon? Does this system provide food security? This course will provide students with an understanding of how global and local political/financial systems have extracted wealth from farmers, and have left the Lebanese in a state of fluctuating food insecurity. We will look at commodity chains, crop selection, markets, farmer to farmer relations, and the role of Syrian crops entering the country. We will draw on the work of NGOs, UNEP reports, media, policy papers, and the academic literature.

			<h3>FOOD 0280 Middlebury's Foodprint:  Introduction to Food Systems Issues (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Food systems encompass all activities, people and institutions determining movement of food from input supply and production (on land and water) through waste management. The dominant U.S. food system is responsible at least in part for some of the nation’s most troubling environmental and health challenges. What do we eat at Middlebury? What difference does it make? How do we know?  We will examine impacts of how Middlebury sources and consumes its food, and disposes of food waste, as a lens to understand sustainable food systems and how they can be achieved.

			<span class="course_description">Students in this course will learn to analyze power and justice in relation to the food system. We will explore cases in which groups of people are experiencing injustice in opportunities to make a living through food production or other food system activities, inequitable access to food and resources, inequitable health outcomes related to diet (e.g., diabetes, obesity), and silencing or lack of political participation. Students will investigate organizations of their choice that are working to remedy inequitable power relations in the food system, and will present their findings to the rest of the class.

			<span class="course_description">Whose sustainability is threatened now, and why does it matter?  How do the Sustainable Development Goals adopted in 2015 perpetuate existing power asymmetries that hurt marginalized people and block systemic transformation?  We will review the rise of “sustainable development’ and the major emphases of sustainability science to assess whether they are addressing the needs of marginalized people.  Then we will examine resistance to neoliberalism and the articulation of alternatives to it from social movements, advocacy, and other approaches. Are alternatives arising that offer radically different and more sustainable patterns of production and consumption to meet life needs? 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Agroecology takes advantage of natural processes to the greatest extent possible, using biological inputs rather than purchased pesticides and fertilizers. In addition to having major benefits for poor farmers in developing countries, it is attracting increased attention as an alternative to industrialized agriculture in wealthy countries. The course will include field trips to farms, films, and discussion of readings.

<p>All majors study abroad for a semester or a year in a French-speaking country. The year program carries nine units of credit; the semester program carries four or five units of credit. In order to ensure that students are exposed to a variety of disciplines, no more than five units (full-year program) or three units (semester program) may be counted toward the French and Francophone Studies major. Most courses in France will be at the advanced level.</p>
<p><strong>The French and Francophone Studies Department does not offer a joint major.</strong></p>
<h2>Required for a Minor</h2>
<p>Minimum of five courses, FREN 0205 and above, including at least two introductory courses (FREN 0209, FREN 0210, FREN 0220-0239) and at least one course at the advanced level (Category IV) to be taken during the student’s final two semesters.

<p>Students with a College Board AP score of 4 or 5 will receive one unit of credit toward graduation if the first course successfully completed at Middlebury is FREN 0209 or above in accordance with placement and departmental advising. AP credits may not be counted toward the major or minor.</p>
<h2>Senior Work</h2>
<p>Upon completing at least two 0300-level courses in French or Francophone studies, majors are required to complete senior work consisting of a significant research paper in the context of a senior seminar (0400-level).</p>
<h2>Honors</h2>
<p>Exceptional students with a grade point average in French and Francophone Studies of 3.8 or higher may petition the department to pursue an independent project for honors in French and Francophone Studies. Candidates for honors may propose a one-semester senior honors essay (FREN 0700) or a senior honors thesis (FREN 0701, one semester and winter term). Eligible students should consult the departmental guidelines and present their proposals well in advance of registration for the term in which the work is to be started. The department will determine whether to award honors, high honors, or highest honors on the basis of a student’s work in the department and performance on the senior honors project.</p>
<h2>International and Global Studies Major with French Language</h2>
<p>Along with other required courses and senior work as described in the International and Global Studies Major section, completion of the French language component requires: (1) proficiency in French (a minimum of two of (FREN 0209, FREN 0210, FREN 0220-0239) or work in the French summer school at the 0300 level or above); (2) at least one semester, and preferably a year, at the Middlebury College School in France, or in Cameroon, or in another French-speaking country; and (3) one or more courses at the 0300 or 0400-level upon return from abroad.</p>
<h2>International and Global Studies Major, European Studies Track</h2>

<p>(1) Language proficiency: see above; (2) regional specialization: choose from FREN 0230 and courses at the 0300-level, or others (Vermont campus), in consultation with the track director; courses in French or Francophone studies at Middlebury in France or in another French-speaking country; (3) disciplinary specialization: two courses from (FREN 0209, FREN 0210, FREN 0220-0239); three advanced French or Francophone studies courses at Middlebury or one of the Middlebury Schools in France; (4) at least one semester, and preferably a year, at the Middlebury College School in France or in another French-speaking country; and (5) one or more courses at the 0300 or 0400 level, or senior independent work in French, upon return from abroad.</p>
<h2>Study Abroad in France and in Cameroon</h2>
<p>Middlebury offers both year and semester abroad programs in France (Paris, Poitiers and Bordeaux) and in Cameroon.  Students planning to study in France or Cameroon must have completed two full years of college credit by the time they undertake their study abroad; they must have successfully completed at least one course beyond FREN 0209 (previously FREN 0210)  by the time they arrive abroad; and they must have an average in French of at least B. We expect all applicants to demonstrate their commitment to French and maintain their fluency by continuous study of French from the time of their enrollment at Middlebury and to maintain their academic level if they are accepted to study abroad.  They are required to take a French course in the semester before study abroad. Students may count three courses from the semester program, five from the full year program toward a major in French; two courses from the semester program and three from the full year program toward a minor in French.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while students wishing to attend one of our programs in France or in Cameroon must demonstrate a level of proficiency in the language that will allow them to function successfully in the French or Cameroonian university setting, they need not be French majors: the C.V. Starr-Middlebury School in France (Paris, Poitiers, and Bordeaux) offers students the opportunity to take courses in history, history of art, economics, cinema, political science, psychology, sociology, studio art, the natural sciences, and the environment, among other disciplines, in addition to courses in languages and literature. Students interested in studying abroad should speak to someone in the Office of International Programs &amp; Off-Campus Study, Sunderland Language Center, well in advance of applying. They will need to seek prior approval of School in France and School in Cameroon courses from the appropriate department chairs if they wish course work to count toward a specific minor or major. The Office of Off-Campus Study will provide information about the program and application forms.</p>

In this course we will study significant literary and socio-political movements that took place in the Francophone world during the twentieth century. Through the critical study and textual analysis of poetry, fiction, and essays, we will explore movements such as Négritude (Sub-Saharan Africa, Antilles and French Guiana), Antillanité and Créolité (Antilles), Indigénisme and Spiralisme (Haiti), as well as “colonial” and “post-independence” literatures from the Maghreb and Sub-Saharan Africa.

			<span class="course_description">Multiple forms of traveling emerged with the expansion of the French empire, from colonial ventures to forced migration. In this course we will study how writers represent such experiences. We will discuss fictions that focus on mobility, passages, and border-crossing, and question what these fictions reveal about the cultures in contact. How do travel and migration narratives reconfigure the relation between here and there, self and other, the individual and the community?  Studying literary texts in their historical contexts will allow us to discuss varied topics, such as nationhood, slavery, exoticism, identity, and difference, as well as to explore several artistic movements that have shaped French and Francophone culture. Writers will include Montesquieu, Balzac, Baudelaire, Madame de Staël, Gide, Césaire, Glissant, and Sinha. (FREN 0209, 0210 or placement) 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">In this interdisciplinary course we will examine the evolving social and political landscape of France in the 21st century. How is French society reconciling contemporary challenges with deeply entrenched institutions and values?  How does everyday life reflect the evolution of long-term trends?  How are immigration, growing inequalities, and membership in the European Union challenging French identity and the notion of “Frenchness”?  We will focus our attention on demography and the family, the educational system, politics, and the French social model or welfare state. Emphasis will be on oral expression and the acquisition of specialized vocabulary.  Sources will include articles from the French and American press, documents, and film. This course is recommended for all students planning to study in France.

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will explore representations of animals in French literature. Animals have played an important role in literature, yet, in post-Darwinian modernity their depiction became increasingly tied to a questioning of the human/animal divide. What are the recurrent motifs and concerns that shape depictions of animals in 19th and 20th century French literature?  What ethical and social questions do they raise?  We will study fictional works of animal metamorphosis, and literary accounts of zoos and animal spectacles, as well as ways in which animals have been used as a rhetorical device to de-humanize "Others"—women and foreigners, in particular. We will read texts by Baudelaire, Balzac, Maupassant, Flaubert, Colette, Vercors, and Darrieussecq. (FREN 0220-0229 or by waiver). 3 hrs. lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

How did the French curriculum shape the identity of Caribbean children? What methods did these writers use to resist assimilation? By focusing on first-person narratives from a variety of French Caribbean countries we will study topics such as colonization, alienation, diversity, inclusion, and equity. Writers will include Chamoiseau, Condé, Pineau, Victor, and Tyrolien. <strong>This course is part of the Public Humanities Labs Initiative administered by the Axinn Center for the Humanities.</strong> (FREN 0220-0230 or by waiver) 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>FREN 0335 Language Ideologies in the Francophone World (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Is French really in danger? Does it need to be defended? Language ideologies have prevailed in France since the foundation of the French Academy in 1635. New waves of language defenders emerged in the 20th century especially against English in the technological and entertainment industry. In this course, we will examine the history of French language ideologies in the Francophone world from the 17th to the 21st century in order to better understand French attitudes toward the “bon usage”. In addition to theoretical works, we will explore language laws, newspaper articles, social media posts, radio news, and documentaries.

			<h3>FREN 0340 Social Mobility and France's "Transclasses" (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Traditionally perceived as stable and rigid, France's class stratification has evolved significantly since the 1960s. However, inequalities based on one's socioeconomic origins persist. Accordingly, the <em>transclasses</em>—those individuals having acquired a different class status over their lifetime—have attracted a great deal of recent attention: do they confirm the existence of social mobility or are they the “exception that proves the rule of social reproduction?” Through historical, sociological, and literary analysis we will debate this question. Sections will include: the history of socioeconomic inequality; French sociological theories that explain both continuity and change of class structure; current literary figures who embody the <em>transclasse</em> experience.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>GSFS 0191 Gender and the Body (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">What is your gender and how do you know? In order to answer this question, we need to consider how gender is known through biology, psychology, consumer capitalism, and our everyday embodiment.  We will also look at how the meaning and performance of gender have changed over time from Classical Greece to Victorian England to the contemporary U.S.  Throughout, we will consider how gender does not operate along, but is always entangled with, race, class, sexuality, nationality, and ability.  3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>GSFS 0209 Gender Health Environment (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Growing concern for the protection of the environment and human health has led policy makers and scholars to consider ways in which gender, class, and race and other forms of identity mediate human-environment interactions.  In this course we will explore how access to, control over, and distribution of resources influence environmental and health outcomes both in terms of social inequities and ecological decline.  Specific issues we will cover include: ecofeminism, food security, population, gendered conservation, environmental toxins, climate change, food justice, and the green revolution.  We will draw comparisons between different societies around the globe as well as look at dynamics between individuals within a society.  The majority of case studies are drawn from Sub Saharan Africa and Asia, however some comparisons are also made with the United States. <em>(National/Transnational Feminisms)</em> 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>GSFS 0235 Gender Politics of the Arab World (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The aim of this course is to explore the ways in which the social and cultural construction of sexual difference shapes the politics of gender and sexuality in the Middle East and North Africa. Using interdisciplinary feminist theories, we will explore key issues and debates including the interaction of religion and sexuality, women’s movements, gender-based violence, queerness and gay/straight identities. Looking at the ways in which the Arab Spring galvanized what some have called a “gender revolution,” we will examine women’s roles in the various revolutions across the Arab World, and explore the varied and shifting gender dynamics in the region.

			<h3>GSFS 0242 Critical Conditions: Gender, Literature, and Illness (Pre-1800) (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will explore the literary representation of illness and pain in a range of texts from the classical period to the present day, focusing in particular on the intersection of illness with questions of gender, race, and sexuality. Beginning with Sophocles’s tragedy Women of Trachis, we will explore the classical representation of acute pain in the context of early Greek medicine, before examining medieval and early modern literary works inspired by the Black Death, including selections from Boccaccio’s Decameron. The second half of the class will focus on modernist and contemporary accounts of illness, including Virginia Woolf’s treatment of both the 1918 influenza epidemic and so-called “shell-shock” in her novel Mrs Dalloway. We will intersperse our literary readings with theoretical explorations of cure, disability, and ableism by writers such as Eli Clare, as well as work from the emerging field of narrative medicine. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>GSFS 0254 American Women Poets (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">We will examine the rich tradition of lyric poetry by women in the U.S. Beginning with the Puritan Anne Bradstreet, one of the New World's earliest published poets, we continue to the 19th century and Emily Dickinson, along with the formidable line of "poetesses" who dominated the popular poetry press in that era. We examine the female contribution to the Modernist aesthetic in figures like Millay, Moore, H.D. and Gertrude Stein; the transformation of modernist ideals by Bishop, Plath, Sexton, and Rich; and, among the postmodernists, Lyn Hejinian and Susan Howe. 3 hrs. lect.

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will explore and examine how genders and sexualities are constructed and the  implications that such constructions have on individuals and societies. We will examine the  theories, concepts, practices, and beliefs about sex, gender, sexuality, and sexual identity and  explore how these concepts are different between different groups and how they have changed  over time, specifically using an intersectional lens. Students will be encouraged to discuss  intricacies of their own sexual and gender identities and how these statuses may impact their  social status and their relationships with others and the larger society. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will consider the creation and performance of masculinities in the American context.  We will ask how masculinity is constructed and how concepts of masculinity intersect with class, race, sexuality, and nation. Topics will include: The construction of idealized notions of masculinity in opposition to both femininities and subordinated masculinities; depictions of masculinity in the media; male socialization and boyhood; the workplace, family life and fatherhood; trans and gender queer masculinities; men’s health; men as perpetrators and victims of violence; and explicitly male-focused social movements and subcultures (such as pro-feminist men; Men’s Rights Activism; Pick-Up artists, Incels).</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>GSFS 0268 Literature of Displacement: Forced Migration, Diaspora, Exile (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will study postcolonial literature about migration, displacement, exile, and diaspora.  Spurred variously by force, necessity and desire, migrants leave their homes and homelands with regret and with hope.  Writers address the historical forces that propel these migrations: decolonization and neo-colonialism, globalization, warfare, dispossession, political violence, religious conflict, and environmental catastrophe.  They experiment with narrative form and poetic language to explore the experiences of undocumented immigrant workers, exiles, refugees and well-to-do migrants.  We will examine how displacement shapes constructions of identity, history, community and place in texts by writers such as Anzaldua, Ali, Darwish, Diome, Patel, Gomez Pena, Said, Rushdie, and others.

			<h3>GSFS 0289 Introduction to Queer Critique (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will examine what is meant by queer critique through exploring the concepts, issues, and debates central to queer theory and activism both in the U.S. and around the world. We will work to understand how queerness overlaps with and is distinct from other articulations of marginalized sexual subjectivity. We will consider how desires, identities, bodies, and experiences are constructed and represented, assessing the ways in which queer theory allows us to examine sexuality and its raced, classed, gendered, geographic, and (dis)abled dimensions. Through engaged projects, we will practice how to translate and produce queer critique. 3 hrs. lect./disc.*This course is part of the Public Humanities Labs Initiative administered by the Axinn Center for the Humanities.*</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will examine a range of discourses about pleasure, happiness, and joy as well as explore these topics more experientially. How have feminists interrupted gendered, raced, and ableist notions of happiness? As Sara Ahmed asks, can there be joy in being the “killjoy”? What is the role of laughter and joy in survival, anti-oppression work, and healing from trauma? We will trace the "pleasurable feminisms" of leading Black feminists and sex positive feminists such as Audre Lorde, adrienne maree brown, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Gayle Rubin, Betty Dodson, as well as investigate our own inherited and intentional perceptions of pleasure. Assignments will include research, writing and workshops. 3 hrs. lect. <strong>This course is part of the Public Humanities Labs Initiative administered by the Axinn Center for the Humanities.*</strong></span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>GSFS 0304 Gender, Culture, and Power (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">This course offers a cross-cultural introduction to the issues involved in the study of women and gender.  Such an endeavor raises a number of difficult and delicate issues.  What explains the diversities and similarities in women's roles across societies?  How do we assess women's status and power, and how do we decide which standards to use in doing so?  What forces create changes in women's roles?  What is the relationship between gender constructions and the nature of communities, economies, and even nations?  Our analysis will concentrate on three primary domains: family and kinship, symbolic systems, and political economy. Course readings will focus primarily on non-Western societies.  3 hrs. lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">White people did not just appear out of nowhere. Instead, they are the result of a long history of structural and everyday racism that was always intertwined with class, sex, sexuality, and nation. We will explore how whiteness became a foundational category for citizenship in the US, especially after the Civil War when the Color Line was drawn through the legal, cultural, and spatial practices of Jim Crow. We will consider how "new immigrants" and even white "trash" became white primarily through the exclusion of Black Americans. Finally, we will look at the formation of whiteness today as a site of privilege, aggrieved entitlement, and violence. 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>GSFS 0325 American Misogyny (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will explore the place of misogyny in U.S. media and politics.  Early topics will include film noir, Cold War gender scapegoating, and lesbian pulp fiction.  Subsequent topics will include the backlash against second-wave feminism, the rise of “post-feminism,” and the impact of reality TV and social media on feminist and antifeminist expression.  We will conclude by examining how misogyny informs U.S. culture and politics in the Trump era. Throughout the course, we will consider how discourses of misogyny are inflected by white, cisgender, ableist, ageist, and class privilege. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>GSFS 0329 The Politics of Reproduction: Sex, Abortion, and Motherhood (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will examine contemporary reproductive issues both in the United States and around the world. We will work to understand both how reproductive politics are informed by broader cultural ideas regarding gender, race, class, ability, sexuality, and geography and also how ideas about reproduction reinforce conceptions of these very identity markers and ways of experiencing the world. Because requirements for being considered a “good” woman are intimately tied to what it means to be a “good” mother, challenging dominant understandings of gender and sexuality requires critical engagement with ideas about reproduction. <strong>This course is part of the Public Humanities Labs Initiative administered by the Axinn Center for the Humanities.</strong> 3 hrs. lect. <em>(Critical Race Feminisms, National/Transnational Feminisms)/</em></span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>GSFS 0334 Feminist Epistemologies: Knowledge, Ignorance and Social Power (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">As a philosophical field, epistemology investigates questions of what constitutes knowledge and understanding and how we acquire such goods. Feminist epistemologies seek to answer these questions while giving special attention to how social relations of power shape our practices and possibilities of knowledge and ignorance. In this seminar we will trace the vast development of feminist epistemologies from the 1980s to the present. We will explore both how these feminist approaches have contributed to a shift in the landscape of epistemology generally, and how they have offered crucial tools for feminist and critical race theorists seeking to understand the reality of and experiences of oppression. Topics will include situated knowing, objectivity, trust (and distrust) in testimony, and epistemic injustices due to bias. 3 hrs, sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

How is marriage understood through idealizations of romance as well as familial expectations of duty or status? In this course we consider how other cultures’ views on love, sex, and partnership are made legible and illegible within broader cultural, moral, and state interests. The course asks for in-depth participation, short weekly writings, and a longer final paper that each engage ethnographic works on a range of topics, from critical studies of love and globalization to queer kinmaking, rituals of the ‘lavish wedding,’ and everyday ways of hooking up and breaking up online. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will explore the dynamics of spectatorship, audience engagement, and fan communities, from Hitchcock to anime, from The Beatles to BLACKPINK, from Star Trek to The Untamed. How do we engage with media texts? Is our experience of media today radically different from the early years of cinema? What does it mean to be a fan? Have our notions of fandom changed over time? How do race, gender, class, and cultural context inform media engagement? We will consider key theoretical approaches and interrogate our own position as spectators, consumers, and fans in media culture.

			<span class="course_description">What does sexuality have to do with race? Does racialization inform much of what we understand about gender? Black queer/trans life and thought speaks to much of these concerns. We’ll be challenged to think through ways that oppressions like anti-Black racism, misogyny, and homo/transphobia operate against (and even within) Black queer and Black trans communities, as well as the ways in which these communities respond and create their own theories/practices of life &amp; joy through an examination of Black queer studies that looks across the African diaspora for theories and methodologies which span a range of social, political, and cultural geographies.(BLST 0101 or GSFS 0191, or by instructor approval)</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

However, female activists are often ignored in historical accounts of these movements. In this course, we will examine the contributions of Black female activists to the Black Freedom Struggle. We will discuss women in the Civil Rights Movement both in the South and the North, the role of women in the Black Panther Party, but also the active involvement of women in white supremacist campaigns in the South. We will pay special attention to the diversity of Black women’s perspectives and highlight how Black women’s experiences differed from both white female and Black male activists.

			<h3>GSFS 0389 Decolonizing Porn: Circulating Desire between Europe and the Americas (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will use feminist, queer, critical race, and decolonial theories to analyze porn in Europe and the Americas. The goal is to give students the analytic tools they need to think deeply about the centrality of porn to our lives and to global capitalism, creating jobs in the “gig economy” as well as huge amounts of profit even as it extracts unpaid labor from trafficked bodies. We will consider pornographic photography, cinema, AI, and deep fakes. Texts will include Linda Williams’ <em>Hard Core: Power, Pleasure, and the ‘Frenzy of the Visible</em>,” Gayle Rubin’s “<em>Thinking Sex</em>,” Heather Berg, <em>Porn Work</em> and Jennifer Nash’s <em>The Black Body in Ecstasy</em>. In the SPAN section of the course, students will also be asked to participate in Spanish at least three times on the Spanish-language day of the class.

It is impossible to understand sexuality as separate from other dimensions of the human condition such as economics, politics, work, family, race, and gender.  In particular, we will examine questions related to the science of sex, morality, monogamy, sex work, power and domination, desire and fantasy, and sexual politics. Overall, students will gain an understanding of sexuality as a social phenomenon. 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

The ways in which racialized and gendered populations have experienced and continue to experience geopolitical domination and surveillance constitutes the central theme of the course. Students will develop collaborative and independent research skills. Topics of inquiry include: the trans-Atlantic slave trade; prisons and policing; education; (anti-)surveillance technologies; airports and borders. We may draw substantially from texts such as Simone Browne’s <em>Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness</em> and Toby Beauchamp’s <em>Going Stealth: Transgender Politics and U.S. Surveillance Practices</em>.

			<h3>GSFS 0419 Gender, Power, and Politics on the Early Modern Stage (I) (Pre-1800) (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this class we will explore the representation of gendered embodiment on the early modern stage, considering as we do so how theatrical embodiment intersects with other treatments of the body in early modern culture.  We will read both early modern and contemporary theoretical accounts of gender as performance, investigating among other issues the use of boy actors, the representation of specifically “female” disorders (e.g., “suffocation” or hysteria), the performance of maternity, and the treatment of same-sex eroticism. Of particular importance will be the representation of the articulate or angry woman as the “shrew” or “scold,” and we will begin the class with an investigation of so-called “shrew-taming” narratives. Primary readings will include: Shakespeare’s <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> and <em>The Winter’s Tale</em>, Webster’s <em>Duchess of Malfi</em>, and Cavendish’s <em>Convent of Pleasure</em>. We will end the semester with a look at how this material plays out in our current political moment, focusing in particular on the representation of Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, and Christine Blasey Ford. 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

		<h1>Department of Geography</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>Required for the Major</h2>
<p>The geography major consists of 10 courses. All students who elect to major in geography must complete: GEOG 0100; GEOG 0120; ECSC 0112 or ECSC 0170 or GEOG 0150; six elective courses at the 0200 or 0300 level, at least one of which must be at the 0200 and one at the 0300 level; one 0400-level seminar. Any 100 level course not used to satisfy a specific major requirement can count as one of a student’s six geography electives. Only one of the 0200-level courses may be numbered 0250 or above.   The electives and the seminar must be selected in consultation with, and approved by, the major advisor. At least four of the electives must be semester-long courses completed on the Middlebury Campus</p>
<h2>Required for a Joint Major</h2>
<p>The Geography Department frequently offers joint majors with Environmental Studies, Computer Science, and the History of Art and Architecture, and often students design joint majors with other departments and programs. The Geography Joint Major consists of 7 courses. All joint majors must complete: GEOG 0100; GEOG 0120 or GEOG 0150; four elective courses at the 0200 or 0300 level, at least one of which must be at the 0200 and one at the 0300 level; and one 0400 level seminar. Any 100 level course not used to satisfy a specific major requirement can count as one of a student’s four geography electives. All joint majors must complete joint senior work in Geography or an equivalent. ENVS 401 satisfies the required joint work for ENVS-GEOG joint majors. At least two of the electives must be semester-long courses completed on the Middlebury Campus. Students wishing to pursue a joint major with any department or program other than Environmental Studies must submit a formal proposal to their intended Geography advisor for departmental approval. The proposal must describe the proposed program of study, including educational rationale and specific courses to be taken.  All electives and senior work must be approved by their advisor.</p>
<h2>Required for a Minor</h2>
<p>The Geography minor consists of 5 courses: at least one course at the 100-level, one at the 200-level, and three additional Geography courses.</p>
<h2>Advanced Placement</h2>
<p>One course credit will be awarded for an advanced placement (AP) score of 5 in human geography. Geography majors who receive a 5 on the AP exam may count this course credit as one 0200-level equivalent toward their major requirements, but are still required to complete GEOG 0100. The AP credit may not be used to satisfy joint major or minor requirements.</p>
<h2>Departmental Honors</h2>
<p>Students who seek to earn honors are required to write a two-credit honors thesis. They must have at least a 3.3 GPA in the major when they propose the thesis and must have a 3.5 GPA in the major, not including the thesis grade, to be considered for honors upon graduation. In order to complete a senior thesis, students must have a proposal approved by a primary thesis advisor and a secondary reader prior to registering for the first 0701 credit. Upon completion of the thesis, thesis students will present their work in a public lecture and defend the thesis in front of the departmental faculty. Thesis presentations and defenses will typically take place during the final week of classes or the examination period. Upon completion of the presentation and defense, the primary advisor and secondary reader will be responsible for evaluating and grading the thesis. It is strongly encouraged that students considering a thesis discuss their ideas with an advisor during the semester prior to registering for formal thesis credits. Honors will be conferred or denied on the basis of an evaluation of the thesis by the faculty and the student’s GPA in the major, as explained above.</p>

How does socio-economic status relate to spatial patterns of settlement, social organization, access to resources, and exposure to risks? How can geographic information systems (GIS) help geographers explain these spatial patterns and processes? In this course we will apply GIS to a wide range of topics in human geography including urban, environmental, political, hazards, and health. We will learn how to gather, create, analyze, visualize, and critically interpret geographic data through tutorials, collaborative labs, and independent work that culminate in cartographic layouts of our results. 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

At its core, it involves processes that connect places and people through the flow of ideas, technology, goods, and information, which as they move from place to place and are adopted, disrupts local and indigenous cultures, economies, and even political systems. These processes tend to homogenize cultures and tastes and are therefore a source of conflict over heritage, memory, and power. These clashes over the “nature” of society embody the global-local divide. In this course we will interrogate not only when and how the flow of goods and ideas occur but the where, as well. We will examine the geographical impact of these flows, and question why some people/places are more affected by globalization than others. 3 hr lecture.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>GEOG 0208 Land and Livelihoods - From Local to Global (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">How do flows of money, people, materials, and ideas connect local livelihoods to distant sites and global processes? How do geographers study patterns of poverty and inequality at different scales?  How do we define human development and wellbeing, how do we determine who participates, and why does it matter?  In this course we will draw from perspectives in fields ranging from development geography and political ecology to post-colonial studies to examine livelihood dynamics in the Global South. We will use texts, interviews, writing assignments, problem sets, and mapping exercises to explore relationships between economy, identity, and place in an increasingly connected world. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>GEOG 0210 Geopolitics and International Development (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">This course critically examines theories and practices of development in the “global-South,” where in many cases development has been inextricably related to foreign interests of donor countries in the West and of Brazil, India, and China. We will emphasize the importance of territory, security, statehood, and sovereignty in the development process and highlight the evolving nexus between geopolitics and development, with a special emphasis on Africa. We will probe the connections between "development" and "underdevelopment," and ask questions about the possible impact of South-South vs. the historical North-South development. We will focus on the contribution of development to progress, on the one hand, and to its stagnation, on the other, and focus on specific issues like food, population dynamics, resources, and rural- urban relationship. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ECSC 0355 Water Resources and Hydrogeology (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Fresh water is the most fundamental resource sustaining life on the planet. In this course we examine all elements of the hydrologic cycle, focusing first on precipitation and surface water flow and then on subsurface flow. We study examples from across the globe to understand factors influencing water quality and availability, and apply mathematical approaches to quantify constraints on sustainable use. The consequences of climate change and other anthropogenic impacts to the hydrological cycle are examined, and current issues and policies are discussed in light of increasing demands on water resources and associated natural systems.

		<h1>Department of German</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>Requirements for the Major</h2>
<p>Students are normally required to complete eight courses in German, above GRMN 0299, including at least one advanced level seminar (above GRMN 0399) or a 0700 level honors thesis during the senior year. Where appropriate, one course may be taken in English. At the beginning of each term a placement test is administered for incoming students to determine which course would be most suitable for their level of competence. The department expects that majors will spend at least one semester of study in a German-speaking country before graduating. Normally, they will spend one or two semesters at the <a href="http://www.fu-berlin.de/">Freie Universität</a> in Berlin, the <a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/university-of-potsdam.html" title="zur Startseite des Bereichs Universität Potsdam">Universität Potsdam</a> and/or the Johannes Gutenberg-Universität in Mainz. Before enrolling in one of our Schools in Germany, students must complete two courses at the 0300-level. For more information, please consult our <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/german/resources/study-abroad-and-summer-language-school">study abroad</a> section.</p>
<h2>Honors</h2>
<p>To be a candidate for honors, students must have an average of at least B+ in German. Honors work (a senior thesis or project) is normally done during a student’s last year at Middlebury.</p>
<h2>Minor in German</h2>
<p>The German minor consists of a sequence of five courses, taught in German, starting at or above the 0200-level. At least three of those courses must be at the 0300-level or higher and <em>at least three of the five required courses have to be taken during the regular academic year at Middlebury College.</em> First-year students who place above the 0200-level in the placement test must take at least one 0400-level course as part of their minor. One course may be satisfied through advanced placement (AP) credit in combination with a departmental placement test.</p>
<h2>Credit for Advanced Placement </h2>
<p>Credit for Advanced Placement is given for scores of 4 or 5, a high score on the departmental placement test, and a placement conference with the student. In addition, the student must successfully complete at least one course above the 0200-level in the department, <em>taught in German</em>, to qualify for AP credit.</p>
<h2>Study in Germany</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://catalog.middlebury.edu/academics/german/about/studyingermany">Middlebury School in Germany</a> has sites located in Berlin, Potsdam and Mainz.</p>

		<h1>Global Health Minor</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><p>The minor in Global Health is more flexible than many other majors and minors on campus. Students design a course of study within the minor that fits their own educational goals. Choosing courses therefore requires substantial thought and planning on the part of the student.</p>
<p>The minor in Global Health is available to students who complete the courses listed below. No course for the minor may also count towards a student’s major. No more than two courses taken from the same department may count towards the minor.</p>
<h2>Courses</h2>
<p>All students must take a total of five courses for the minor:</p>
<p>(1) the core course:</p>
<p>SOAN 0267 Global Health or INTD 0257 Global Health</p>
<p>(2) One of the following methods courses (if the methods requirement is met through coursework for a major, students may substitute an additional elective in place of a methods class):</p>
<ul><li>ANTH 0302 The Research Process: Ethnography and Qualitative Methods</li>
<li>BIOL 0211 Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis</li>
<li>ECON 0210 Economic Statistics</li>
<li>GEOG 0120 Human Geography with GIS</li>
<li>GEOG 0150 ENV Geography with GIS</li>
<li>GHLT 0232 Principles of Epidemiology</li>

<li>PSYC 0201 Psychological Statistics</li>
<li>SOCI 0385 Social Statistics (formerly SOAN 0385)</li>
<li>AP credit for Statistics</li>
</ul><p>(3) Three elective courses; no more than one course may be a 0100-level course. Classes that count as electives are listed on the “Courses” tab.</p>
<h2>Petition for Course Credit</h2>
<p>Many other appropriate courses exist on campus, depending on the educational goals of a particular student. Courses may be substituted for the methods or elective courses with the approval of the program director. Approval requires submission of a <a data-entity-substitution="media" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9aa53606-edfe-4f56-b9b7-d5421425c797" href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/sites/www.middlebury.edu.college/files/2022-05/petition_for_gh_course_credit_2022.pdf?fv=-gJ2BTht">petition for course credit form</a>. Approval of a course for minor credit requires the student to show that they made connections between the course material and their study of Global Health, for example by writing a final paper on a public health topic. Students must turn in this paper or other approved course material for review for credit.</p>
<h2>Declaring the Minor</h2>
<p>To declare the minor, submit the following to the Program Director: (1) a <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/office/registrar/forms">minor declaration form</a> and (2) a 200-500 word statement explaining how the classes you chose fit together and further your educational goals within the field of Global Health. To declare the minor, these materials must be submitted at least one week before the end of the add period of your seventh semester at Middlebury.</p>
<p>In addition, students minoring in Global Health are strongly encouraged to take advantage of Middlebury’s resources by studying abroad, preferably in a program with health-related courses, and by becoming proficient in a foreign language.</p>

			<h3>HEBM 0231 Zionism and the "Roads Not Taken" (1880-1948) (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">An Arab-Jewish binational state in Palestine was only one of the possible paths that the Zionist movement considered before taking the road that led to Israel’s 1948 establishment. Using various primary and secondary sources, we will critically engage with alternatives to the nation-state within the Zionist movement, unfolding key debates in its history. In the introductory units, we will position Zionism alongside other forms of Jewish nationalism, such as Simon Dubnow’s Diaspora Nationalism. We will then zoom in on post-World War I Zionism, discussing Imperial, anti-Imperial, pan-Asian, and binationalist-federalist alternatives to the Jewish nation-state program. In the concluding units, we will examine the processes by which these possibilities became marginalized, and the vision of a Jewish nation-state prevailed.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HEBM 0234 Contemporary Israel: The Politics of Ethnic Difference (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The course explores the politics of ethnic difference in Israel through a combined historical-sociological perspective, using diverse textual and visual materials. After tracing the origins of the ethnic categories of “Ashkenazi” (Western) and Mizrachi (Middle Eastern/North African) Jews, we examine the history of immigration to Israel in the 1950s, considering how ethnicity came to define class and geography. In subsequent units, we will deal with Mizrachi protest movements such as the Israeli 1970s “Black Panthers” and the more recent trend of Mizrachi intellectuals to reclaim the “Arab-Jew” identity, and in comparison, the Mizrachi traditional support of hawkish positions regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the concluding units, we will utilize comparative tools to conceptualize this internal Jewish dynamic.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HEBM 0237 The Origins of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">When did the Jewish-Arab conflict begin? This survey course considers several different moments of its birth, such as the 1880s first wave of Zionist immigrants to Palestine, the 1917 Balfour Declaration, the 1948 and 1967 war and the 1964 establishment of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and other landmark moments. Based on secondary literature and primary textual and visual materials, we will engage with these competing periodizations and analyze various Israeli and Palestinian historical narratives they embody, considering broader themes such as the relations between the historian’s identity and the production of historical narratives, and the dynamic between facts, narratives and ideologies. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HEBM 0238 Intercultural Jerusalem (1850-Present) (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The course approaches the history of modern Jerusalem through the lens of intercultural encounters. Based on primary historical sources and secondary literature, we will examine how the relations between Muslims, Christians, and Jews transformed as the city changed hands between the Ottomans, British, Jordanians, and Israelis. The introductory units will discuss the making of multi-cultural Jerusalem in the late Ottoman period and how, under British rule (1917-1948), its cosmopolitanism was abated by nationalism. We will then discuss its partition following the 1948 War and the emergence of “West Jerusalem” and “East Jerusalem.” Proceeding past 1967, we will examine if and to what extent Jerusalem became an integrated, united city under Israel sovereignty before concluding with a discussion of contemporary trends.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

<h2>Courses in the History Department</h2>
<p>As a rule, the History Department has no pre-requisites except for in designated 400-level courses. Courses are not arranged hierarchically; they are arranged thematically and chronologically, with the 100-level courses being the broadest and the 300 and 400-level courses being the most specific in subject matter.</p>
<h3>HIST 0100-Level Courses</h3>
<p>These courses deal with events and processes that affect human societies over long periods of time and across broad geographical areas not confined to national boundaries. Courses include components that act as introductions to the field of history.</p>
<h3>HIST 0200-Level Courses</h3>
<p>These are lecture courses that deal with a single cultural or national entity, or a clearly related group of such entities, over a substantial period of time (usually a century or more).</p>
<h3>HIST 0300-Level Courses</h3>
<p>These courses, for the most part, are topically focused courses. Many of them are lecture courses and some are taught in a seminar format. These are not, however, seminars that fulfill the reading seminar requirement.</p>
<h3>HIST 0400–Level Reading Seminars</h3>
<p>These topically based seminars, which usually meet once a week involve reading and analyzing texts, discussions, student presentations, historiography and writing or producing a final project. The history department offers many types of seminars: seminars on a topic within a given country or region; transnational or global seminars, digital humanities seminars and public history seminars.  Seminars are open to all students except those designated for seniors and juniors. See course description for requirements. A list of seminars is available from the department.</p>
<h3>HIST 0600: Writing History</h3>
<p>In this course students discuss historical methods and writing strategies to create convincing historical narratives.  With the approval and guidance of the professor, students complete a 20-25-page research paper based on primary and secondary sources. Students take this course in the fall of their junior year or with permission in the spring. If students are away for the entire junior year, they can take the course in the fall of their senior year.</p>
<h3>HIST 0700 &amp; 0701 Senior Honors Thesis</h3>
<p>If students have earned a minimum 3.5 GPA in at least 5 History department courses (including up to two courses taken abroad) and at least a B+ in HIST 0600, they may choose to write a two-term honors thesis (HIST 0700). Writing a thesis is a prerequisite for departmental honors. Students must submit a thesis proposal to the department chair and coordinator one week prior to course registration for the term in which the thesis is to be started. Students opting to write a thesis must also take at least one 0400-level reading seminar prior to graduation, but preferably before their last semester at Middlebury. Students may not write a thesis in the same semester that they are taking HIST 0600. If students submit a request to write a senior thesis in the semester in which they are taking HIST 0600, they may receive conditional approval pending the completion and grade in HIST 0600.</p>
<p>Approved students will write a two-term thesis under an advisor in the area of their choosing. The department strongly encourages students to write their theses during the fall and winter terms. Winter/Spring theses are also acceptable with the permission of the chair and the theses advisor. On rare occasions and for compelling reasons, a student may initiate a thesis in the spring of an academic year and finish in the fall of the following year with the approval of the department. All students beginning their thesis in a given academic year must attend the Thesis Writers’ Workshops held in the fall and winter of that year. Further information about the thesis is available from the department.</p>
<h2>Overall History Honors</h2>
<p>To receive departmental honors, high honors*, or highest honors** students must have completed an honors thesis<em> </em>(HIST0700) with a grade of B+, A-*, or A** and must have achieved an overall average of at least 3.5, 3.67*, or 3.75** in all departmental courses.</p>
<h3>HIST 0100-Level Courses</h3>
<p>The 0100-level courses (0100-0199) deal with events and processes that affect human societies over long periods of time and across broad geographical areas not confined to national boundaries. These courses include components that act as introductions to the field of history.</p>
<h3>HIST 0200-Level Courses</h3>
<p>These are lecture courses that deal with a single cultural or national entity, or a clearly related group of such entities, over a substantial period of time (usually a century or more).</p>
<h3>HIST 0300-Level Courses</h3>
<p>These courses, for the most part, are topically focused courses. Many of them are lecture courses and some are taught in a seminar format. These are not, however, seminars that fulfill the reading seminar requirement.</p>
<h3>HIST 0400-Level Reading Seminars</h3>
<p>Unlike the courses below the 0400 level, which are primarily lecture courses, these courses are reading seminars on particular periods or topics. They are open to all students, although in cases of overcrowding, history majors will be given priority. First-year students are admitted only by waiver.</p>
<h3>HIST 0600 Research Seminar</h3>
<p><strong>All history majors are required to take HIST 0600 their junior fall or, if abroad at that time, their junior spring or senior fall semester</strong>. In this course students will conceive, research, and write a work of history based on primary source material. After reading and discussion on historical methods and research strategies, students will pursue a paper topic as approved by the course professors.</p>
<h3>HIST 0700 and 701 Senior Independent Study I &amp; II</h3>
<p>All senior history majors will write a two-term thesis under an advisor in the area of their choosing. The department encourages students to do their theses during the fall (700) and winter terms (701). Fall/spring theses are also acceptable and, with permission of the chair, winter/spring. On rare occasions, with departmental approval given for compelling reasons, a thesis may be initiated in the spring of an academic year and finished in the fall of the following year. All students beginning their thesis in a given academic year must attend the Thesis Writers’ Workshops held in the fall and winter of that year. Further information about the thesis is available from the department.</p>

			<h3>HIST 0212 Civil War and Reconstruction: 1845-1890 (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">This course explores the era of the American Civil War with an emphasis on the period 1861-1865. It combines lectures, readings, class discussion, and film to address such questions as why the war came, why the Confederacy lost, and how the war affected various elements of society. We will also explore what was left unresolved at the end of the war, how Americans responded to Reconstruction, and how subsequent generations have understood the meaning of the conflict and its legacy. We will make a special effort to tie military and political events to life on the home front. (formerly HIST 0364) 2 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HIST 0216 History of the American West (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">This is a survey of the history of the trans-Mississippi West from colonial contact through the 1980s. It explores how that region became known and understood as the West, and its role and meaning in United States history as a whole. The central themes of this course are conquest and its legacy, especially with regard to the role of the U.S. federal government in the West; human interactions with and perceptions of landscape and environment; social contests among different groups for a right to western resources and over the meanings of western identity; and the role of the West in American popular culture.

			<h3>HIST 0218 Slavery and Freedom in the American North (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will study how the “American North,” constituted by New England, New York,  New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, became a place of enslavement. Although often treated as a cradle  of freedom, we will explore how the region’s colonists imported African slaves and enslaved and  exported Native Americans. Through lecture, discussion, and primary sources, we will examine the transatlantic slave trade of Africans and Native Americans, the communities built by enslaved  and free people, the impact of the American Revolution, the creation of gradual abolition statues,  and the perpetuation of enslavement until the Civil War. We will also grapple with the role of  memory in history, as the region’s slaveholding past is often ignored by its inhabitants. 2 hrs  lect./1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Our study of China’s political progression through successive dynasties will reveal archetypal patterns of historical disruption amidst continuity. We will also examine those perennial social, institutional, and intellectual forces — such as the stratification of the classes, the absolutist tendencies of monarchy, and the civilly-focused yet competitive atmosphere fostered by a state-sponsored examination culture — that proved determinative in shaping China’s traditional development.

We will study the transformation of urban life from the Roman period through the dark years of the early Middle Ages in the West into the flourishing of a new type of European city life in the High Middle Ages. The development of urban institutions, the building of cathedrals, universities and fortifications, and the growth of trade will all be considered, as will the experience of groups such as Jews, women and intellectuals. Although the class will focus on the medieval European city, we will also draw comparisons with cities of the Muslim East. Pre-1800. 3 hrs lect/disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Starting with the revolutionary movement of the early 20th century, we will examine the development and ultimate downfall of the USSR. What was Soviet communism (both in idea and in practice)? How did its implementation and development transform local identities (religious, ethnic/national, social)? How did internal and external factors (political, social, economic) transform Soviet policy and life? Was the collapse of the USSR inevitable? Special attention will be paid both to political leaders and ordinary people (believers, collaborators, victims, dissidents, outcasts). 3 hrs lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HIST 0253 British History: 1603-1815 (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The medieval pattern of English and Scottish society began to implode in the seventeenth century. The unity of the Church, the relationship between Crown and Parliament, even the social hierarchy, were shaken to their foundations. After generations of civil war, revolution, and party strife, the eighteenth century saw the establishment of a flexible, oligarchic order, able to fight off the challenges of radicalism and the American and French revolutions. By 1815 Britain, at the peak of its power in Europe, was already beginning to experience the tensions incumbent on becoming the first industrial nation.

			<h3>HIST 0254 British History 1815-Present (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The spectacular rise and dramatic decline of Britain’s imperial and industrial power is the central theme of this course. The century after 1815 brought political and social reform and the apogee of middle class culture, but in 1914 the crucial problems of women's rights, labor against capital, and Irish nationalism remained unsolved. War, economic depression and the loss of empire followed. The Labour Party envisaged a welfare state and social contract for post-war Britain; the conservative response was free-market Thatcherism. Today, Britain continues to exemplify the promise and perils of what can be called modernity.  3 hrs. lect/disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

We will also study Brazil’s impact on the world, from its export of cultural products in cinema, music, and literature in translation, to soccer. It will be important to study the communities of Brazilians in diverse places such as Miami, New York, London, and Paris. We will utilize various writing, oral, and digital methods to examine the major political, economic, and cultural movements that defined Brazilian history from the creation of the empire in the 1820s to the political and cultural tensions of the current regime 3 hr. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HIST 0305 Confucius and Confucianism (Spring 2023)</h3>

Moreover, the influence of Confucius has spread well beyond China to become entrenched in the cultural traditions of neighboring Japan and Korea and elsewhere. This course examines who Confucius was, what he originally intended, and how the more important of his disciples have continued to reinterpret his original vision and direct it toward different ends.

			<h3>HIST 0313 Revolutionary Russia (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The Russian Revolution was a continuum of violence that, through years of civil war and political, social and cultural revolutions, sought to transform the basis of human existence and usher in a utopian future, imposing “Marxist” values upon diverse local cultures and contexts. We will examine the rise and fall of revolutionary sentiment from late-imperial terrorism through the establishment of Stalin’s dictatorship. Through analysis of primary and secondary sources, students will assess both the manifold ambitions of the revolutionary years and how memory of 1917 has been used to justify, critique and at times repossess aspects of Russian/Soviet history. <strong>This course is part of the Public Humanities Labs Initiative administered by the Axinn Center for the Humanities.</strong> 3 hrs sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HIST 0319 Readings in the Philosophy of History (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Even before the appearance of Georg W. F. Hegel's classic study The Philosophy of History, a heated debate was being waged concerning the nature and substance of history. Is history, like science, expressible in predictable patterns or subject to irrevocable laws? What factors distinguish true history from the mere random succession of events? What should we assume to be the fundamental nature of historical truth, and are we to determine it objectively or subjectively? Is it possible to be human and yet be somehow "outside of" history? These are among the questions we will examine as we read and deliberate on a variety of philosophies of history, while concentrating on the most influential versions developed by Hegel and Karl Marx. 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

In this course we will begin with an overview of the global scale of the second world war and, using a comparative approach, focus on examples of individual suffering. We will then study the war’s effects in select countries around the world. 3 hrs. lect. (No open to students who have already taken IGST/HIST 0473.)</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s 2021 claim that “Russians and Ukrainians were one people – a single whole” was a geopolitical maneuver; nonetheless, it highlighted a deeply intertwined and contested history. In this course we will explore the multifaceted history of Kyiv from its founding to the present day in order to better understand the entangled histories of the contemporary Ukrainian and Russian states. Central to our discussions will be primary and secondary sources that offer conflicting dynastic, religious and national histories which have sought to claim Kyiv as their own. We will also probe Kyiv’s Jewish past to better understand the region’s complex multi-confessional and multi-ethnic past. 3 hrs sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Through primary and secondary source analysis (including textual, visual and aural sources), we will explore the challenges and opportunities this multi-confessional reality posed to Russia’s rulers and the official Orthodox Church. We will also probe the question of what religious faith (in its multiple iterations) meant for subjects from across the social strata and geographic expanse of the empire. How did one lead a spiritually fulfilled life? How did members of different religious faiths interact? What was the relationship between religious and ethnic identities? 3 hrs sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

In the Medieval West, where alchemy and the astrolabe comfortably shared a workroom, intellectuals pursued both with equal fervor and respectability. In this course we will explore the medieval meanings and context of “science” and “magic,” developments in technology, and the relationship of authority and religion to all three through readings in primary sources, critical essays and monographs, and Umberto Eco's historical novel, <em>The Name of the Rose</em>.

Topics will include imperialism, American orientalism, the Cold War, trade wars, and shifting perceptions of hegemony. Through critical reading and discussion we will pay particular attention to how their “special” relationship has shaped China and the United States’ respective evolutions. Students who have taken HIST 479 should not register for this course. Course materials include memoirs, political tracts, Hollywood and Shanghai films, oral histories, and a variety of visual works in complement with scholarly texts.

			<h3>HIST 0403 Race in the British Empire, 1580-1960 (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Race was a significant factor in the formation of Britain’s global empire.  Within the British Isles, the Irish and Highland Scots were racialized as “Celts.”  In the Americas, race shaped relations with indigenous peoples and defined systems of Black enslavement.  Later, it informed British expansionism in South Asia, the Pacific and Africa, as well as eugenics policies and responses to independence movements.  This course examines shifting interpretations of racial categories within Britain itself and the British empire overseas, from the Tudor period down to the beginning of large-scale immigration into Britain from South Asia and the Caribbean. 3 hr. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HIST 0435 American Conservatism after 1932: Ideology, Politics, History (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">“Let’s grow up, conservatives!” was Sen. Barry Goldwater’s dictum at the 1960 Republican convention. Once dismissed as practically extinct, American conservatism became the most enduring political movement of the 20th century. In this seminar we will trace conservative thought and politics from the New Deal era through the contemporary moment, highlighting both domestic and international developments that shaped the modern American right. Students will closely engage with recent scholarly works as well as primary sources such as speeches, magazines, campaign texts, and visual media to effectively understand conservatism’s historical evolution. 3 hrs. sem</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">This course takes up the challenge of understanding women's experiences and the role of gender in Africa's past. We will read from a wide variety of disciplinary perspectives and literary forms, including ethnographies, life histories, and fiction, in order to explore different methodological and interpretive approaches to these subjects. Themes will include: changes in the structure of patriarchy and women's status in the pre-colonial period, the gendered impact of colonial rule on African economies and ecologies, historical identities of masculinity and femininity, and gendered experience of postcolonial "development."

We will survey the law and ethics of human-animal relations in religious sources and engage with issues such as how humans differ from non-human “animals,” how they should treat animals, and the overall place and roles of animals in divine creation as reflected within different historical periods. We will also consider the impact of the modern animal liberation movement in the Middle East and examine a variety of religious and secular positions formulated by Muslims that have recently prioritized animal welfare and promoted environmental consciousness.

			<h3>HIST 0467 Approaching Historical Truth: Methods and Evidence in History Writing (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this seminar we will learn about how historians have approached problems of evidence and explanation. We will consider methodologies that historians have adapted from other disciplines, including the natural and social sciences as well as literary and cultural studies. We will also consider what distinguishes historical from fictional narratives. In the first part of the course we will explore the role of social and institutional power in shaping historians’ approaches to evidence, with special attention to the role of archives. In the second, we will examine a recent historical controversy or a single historical study for its argument and presentation of evidence. In the final part, students will design and execute their own research projects. Seminar.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HARC 0100 An Introduction to Global Visual Culture (Fall 2022, Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">This course is an introduction to the visual cultures of the world, with an emphasis on how images, objects, and monuments are made, experienced, exchanged, and used by groups of people with diverse religious, socio-economic, and cultural backgrounds. We will focus on themes that have been taken up by different cultures and adapted over time, such as monumentality, the sacred, embodiment, science, and technology. Through a close study of these themes, we will consider how materials, cultures, and histories are transformed and negotiated through making and viewing works of art. In the process, we will challenge the art historical canon by shedding light on marginalized periods, regions, and artworks. 2 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

We will study such structures as Charlemagne's Palace Chapel and the reliquary statue of Ste. Foy at Conques to explore how these monuments were products of independent cultures that valued the creation of a visual fusion between the Judeo-Christian God and humankind.  Likely lines of inquiry include: the persistence of a Classical ideal and its myriad adaptations; the coordination of art objects to specific locations; and, not least, the self-conscious staging of political and ecclesiastical power. 3 hrs lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HARC 0231 Architecture and the Environment (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Architecture has a dynamic relationship with the natural and cultural environments in which it operates. As a cultural phenomenon it impacts the physical landscape and uses natural resources while it also frames human interaction, harbors community, and organizes much of public life. We will investigate those relationships and explore strategies to optimize them, in order to seek out environmentally responsive architectural solutions. Topics to be covered include: analysis of a building's site as both natural and cultural contexts, passive and active energy systems, principles of sustainable construction, and environmental impact. Our lab will allow us to study on site, "off-the-grid" dwellings, hay-bale houses, passive solar constructions and alternative communities, meet with "green" designers, architects, and builders, and do hands-on projects. 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HARC 0250 Baroque Art in a Global Context (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Baroque art and architecture flourished in the courts of seventeenth-century Europe before spreading to the Americas, Asia, and Africa in the wake of global trade, colonialism, and religious proselytizing.  In this course we will examine how this style of art and architecture was recontexualized and transformed when it came into contact with preexisting traditions overseas. Readings and discussions will compare artistic production across cultures by focusing not only on the forces that contributed to the broad reach of the Baroque, but also on the persistence of local artistic styles, which were challenged and nurtured by sustained intercultural contact. 3 hrs. lct.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">This survey course will consider closely the major architectural monuments of the Gothic period in Western Europe, using them as a point of departure in a larger consideration of the artistic culture of this time.  In looking at Gothic art and architecture, the class will ask some of the following questions: How were buildings embedded in the promotion of distinct political programs?  How do liturgical considerations determine the shapes of buildings and sites?  How can we track the emergence of a non-Christian "other" in art of all media?  How can we characterize the visual and intellectual culture of "courtly love"? 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HARC 0254 Vermeers's World: 17th-century Dutch Art in a Global Context (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The artists of the so-called Dutch “Golden Age”—Rembrandt van Rijn, Johannes Vermeer, Frans Hals, and many others—are best known for their portraits of wealthy Dutch citizens, landscapes of the local countryside, and scenes of domestic merry-making. The widespread popularity of images of local people and places, however, obscures the significant global activities of the Dutch Republic in the seventeenth century. This course will reexamine the works of these well-known Dutch artists by placing them in the context of global trade and colonialism.  We will consider works in a range of media—including paintings, prints, books, textiles, and ceramics—that pictured and mediated diplomatic, social, and economic negotiations between the nascent Dutch Republic and the cultures it encountered across the globe.3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

In this course we will chronicle the major developments of architecture as a cultural endeavor from its beginnings in the Neolithic in the Near East to the Industrial Revolution in Europe, considered within a global perspective. Attention will be given to formal and structural innovations, often borrowed across cultures and periods. Introductory in nature, the course combines lectures, discussions, and workshops, and is open to all curious students. 3 hrs. lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

How does the art of our time open the present for us to explore and critique, just as it offers glimmers of possible futures? In attempting to answer these questions, in this course we will survey major developments in international art practice from 1960 to the present. Throughout we will consider the diverse formal strategies of contemporary art alongside the radical upheavals of the recent past and present, from the world-wide protests of the 1960s to the global crisis of climate change and the connectivity (and isolation) of the digital world.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HARC 0268 Arts of Asia (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">This course considers South and East Asian art history from its most ancient origins in India, China, and Japan to the present. This is not a comprehensive survey; rather, it focuses on cross-cultural connections through selected art works, considered individually and in broader contexts. We will chronicle the evolutions of painting, sculpture, architecture, and other media of Asia, focusing especially on painting, sculpture, architecture, and decorative arts. We will pay particular attention to the impact of religious and royal patronage, Buddhism and Hinduism, the Silk Road, Asian aesthetics, and specialized techniques such as ink painting and woodblock printing. Works of art will be studied in terms of style, religious meaning, and social and historical contexts. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HARC 0272 Mastodons, Mermaids, and Dioramas: Capturing Nature in America (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Why did 18th-century museums stuff and mount exotic and domestic animals? Why does the American Museum of Natural History still house dioramas of so-called native peoples hunting?  How has the study and staging of nature transferred into various kinds of artistic expression?  In this course we will examine the intertwining of art, science, and ecology in the United States from the 1700s to the present day. Objects of study will include museum dioramas, scientific models, artifacts and artworks collected during scientific expeditions, and the work of Walton Ford and Christy Rupp, contemporary artists whose work engages ecological issues.

			<h3>HARC 0281 Viewer Discretion Advised: Controversies in American Art &amp; Museums, 1876-Present (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">What are the “culture wars,” and why do they matter? What ideas are considered too “obscene” for American audiences? In this course we will explore controversies and scandals sparked by public displays of art in the U.S. including: Eakins’s Gross Clinic (1876), seen as too “bloody” for an art exhibition; the U.S. Navy’s objections to Paul Cadmus’s painting of sailors (1934); censorship and NEA budget cuts (Mapplethorpe &amp; Serrano, 1989); backlash to The West as America’s deconstruction of myths of the frontier (1991); tensions surrounding Colonial Williamsburg’s “slave auction” reenactment (1994); debates over the continued display (and occasional defacement) of Confederate monuments in the era of the Black Lives Matter Movement.

			<h3>HARC 0357 Orientalism and the Visual Arts (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will consider the relationship between visual culture and the politics of knowledge. Comparatively examining a series of cross-cultural encounters in modern and contemporary art, we will ask how knowledge is visually codified, labeled, and displayed. The course will begin with a reading of Edward Said’s Orientalism. We will then examine a series of case studies in order to identify and compare strategies of both “representing the other” and “speaking back.” We will address notions of exoticism, cultural difference, authenticity, and native authority with a particular focus on the ways in which the visual arts construct notions of race and gender and difference in representations of the Middle East, and more specifically, the Arab world.  Case studies, drawn from the late eighteenth century until today, will be focused in the discipline of art history and the geographical regions of primarily the Middle East and Africa, as well as Europe and the U.S. 3 hrs sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">The word contemporary is relational; to be con-temporary means to exist with others in time. In this seminar we will explore themes in very recent art, paying particular attention to how various practices draw attention to the constitutive relation of “with” through form. Topics may include artistic responses to social conflict, technological change, expanding global art centers, among others. Specific topics will vary, in part, based on student interests and current debates. Readings will be drawn from critical texts, recent scholarship and artists’ writings.

			<h3>HARC 0364 The State of Emergency and its Aftermaths: Kitchen Design to Counter-History (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this class we will uncover how architecture and design have mitigated and exacerbated the human tragedy of modern industrialized war in the 20th century. Taking the First World War and its inheritances as a through line to the present-day refugee crisis, we will discover how conflicts have manifested spatially (refugee camps to military installations, villages to capital cities), how design cultures of education, care, and memory emerged from battle and conditions of scarcity, and how war often blurred the meaning of what constitutes “architecture.” Shifting the focus from trenches, monuments, and imperial building projects to the architecture of the everyday, we will think about the politics of food systems and garden design, urban (and rural) recovery and reconstruction efforts, the creation of ephemeral and ad-hoc architectures, the role of mechanization, technology, and governmentality, and the gendered implications of states of emergency. <strong>This course is part of the Public Humanities Labs Initiative administered by the Axinn Center for the Humanities.*</strong></span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HARC 0365 Art, Colonialism &amp; the Digital Humanities (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The field of Digital Humanities (DH) combines computational or digital technologies with humanistic research. In this course, digital humanistic inquiry will provide the lens through which we examine the artistic, textual, and archival legacies of European colonialism from the early modern period (late 15th through 18th centuries) to the present. Our focus will be on the visual and material culture of the Spanish, Dutch, and English empires, which included paintings, prints, illustrated texts, ceramics, and textiles, among many other items. Readings for the course will interrogate the structural inequities of power engrained in these sources—many of which persist in museums and other cultural institutions today—alongside recent scholarship in the digital humanities. Students will learn to think critically about the emerging “digital cultural archive,” while also acquiring the skills to create their own digital projects.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HARC 0374 WWI and Its Legacies in Art and Photography (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">“We will glorify war,” declared the Italian poet Marinetti in the 1909 <em>Futurist Manifesto</em>. For Marinetti and his fellow writers and artists, military conflict held the promise of restoring a decadent Europe. Meanwhile, the new technology of photography was being deployed across the Ottoman Empire by European governments to document a declining empire with vast territory up for grabs. The outbreak of World War I, however, soon exposed the grim realities and failed promises of modernity and technologies of warfare. In this course we will consider how art and photography in Europe, America, and across the Ottoman Empire documented, portrayed, and confronted World War I, and the colonial and aesthetic legacies of the first industrialized global war in today’s world. <strong>This course is part of the Public Humanities Labs Initiative administered by the Axinn Center for the Humanities.*</strong></span>			<span class="course_requirements">

		<h1>Independent Scholar Program</h1>
		<article class="requirements">
		The Independent Scholar Program is designed to meet the needs of outstanding students who have clearly defined educational goals that cannot be fulfilled within the framework of a normal departmental or interdisciplinary major. Independent Scholars plan their own curricular programs with the assistance of a faculty adviser. Independent Scholars cannot propose two majors, but can pursue an independent scholar major and one minor. For the 2022-23 academic year, application materials are due to the Curriculum Committee by Monday, October 10, 2022, for fall review; and Monday, February 20, 2023, for spring review.<br><br><strong>Eligibility</strong>: For an application to be considered, a student must be in the sophomore year and have a GPA of 3.5 or higher. If approved, students must fulfill all requirements for the degree using their approved Independent Scholar plan as their major course of study. Independent Scholar proposals will be evaluated in light of feasibility, academic disciplinary integrity, and demonstrated ability of the student. A successful proposal must articulate a fully developed program of study, must include a methods course, and must demonstrate compellingly that the student’s academic goals cannot be met through existing majors.<br><br><strong>Application process</strong>: To be designated an Independent Scholar, a student must undergo a rigorous approval process overseen by the Curriculum Committee. The process begins with an interview with the dean of curriculum. The student must subsequently prepare and submit a well-defined program to the Curriculum Committee, covering a description of the aim of the program, the independent work, and the courses he or she proposes to comprise the major. The proposal must be accompanied by a written endorsement of a faculty member who is willing and qualified to supervise the student, as well as a statement of support from an alternate faculty member. The Curriculum Committee will review all submitted materials, and if warranted, convene a meeting with the candidate and advisers. Final approval rests with the Curriculum Committee. An applicant whose proposal is denied is entitled to meet with the dean of curriculum or the Curriculum Committee.<br><br><strong>Oversight</strong>: The Curriculum Committee will solicit updates from each Independent Scholar twice a year. Changes to the program must also be submitted to the Curriculum Committee, and the faculty supervisor will cosign all registration materials. The Major Declaration Form and Degree Audit Forms will be signed by both the faculty adviser and dean of curriculum. Students who elect to withdraw from the Independent Scholar Program, or who have their independent scholar status withdrawn, may be allowed, at the discretion of the committee, to graduate in general studies, without a formal major in any department.<br><br><strong>Senior work</strong>: The INDE 0800 is a culminating experience for this program of study. This project brings together the course work the student has completed and incorporates all aspects of the study into one final project. Students applying to be independent scholars are asked to provide an indication of possible INDE 0800 projects at the time that they submit their proposals. Students are able, however, to change the topic of their INDE 0800 project in order to respond to new interests and information acquired during the course of their study.<br><br>
The INDE 0800 project is undertaken for one or two terms. Students who wish to be considered for honors must work with a thesis committee. Thesis work most typically follows the procedures for the department most closely related to the project. Others may choose to work with an individual faculty member, usually the student's adviser. The choice of senior project is flexible. For example, with permission from the adviser, a student in the performing arts might want to incorporate a dance performance, musical composition, or some other feature as part of his or her course of study.<br><br><strong>Honors</strong>: In order to be considered for honors, independent scholars normally must meet two criteria: a minimum average of B+ in courses taken towards the major and a minimum grade of B+ on the senior work component. The Dean of Curriculum oversees the first requirement and will inform the adviser of the student's eligibility. The senior work component must be evaluated by a committee of three faculty members (one of whom, at the adviser's request, may be a faculty member on the Curriculum Committee). Minimum thesis grades for each level of honors are B+ (Honors), A- (High Honors), and A (Highest Honors), but the determination of the appropriate level will be made by the thesis committee.<br><br>
For more information about this program, contact the Dean of Curriculum.

These managerial accounting concepts are used to develop budgets and evaluate results. Our understanding of accounting and financial statements is needed to understand how business interrelates with society. The major course project will be developing an Excel financial model; no prior Excel experience required. 3 hrs. lect., 3 hr. lab (not open to students who have taken INTD 0316).</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>INTD 0130 Business Ethics (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Capitalism and competitive markets are often considered the most efficient system of simultaneously maximizing private wealth and public good. In the real world, however, truly competitive markets do not exist.   Imperfect markets have been made to work efficiently while protecting public good through systems of public intervention, i.e., laws and regulations, and voluntary self-restraint by business organizations in response to societal expectations. In this class we will consider the role of ethics in business, with students analyzing the process by which ethical norms and strongly held moral beliefs guide the conduct of economically driven business organizations.  Students will reflect on business managers’ responsibility to their owners, i.e., shareholders, other stakeholders, and society-at-large. 3 hrs. lect./dsc</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">With recent financial scandals and crises, an important question is whether the finance industry should be regulated and should undergo further policy reforms. Many scholars and policy experts contend that the current system is simply not designed to make policy choices on behalf of the public. In this course we will explore current financial innovations (e.g., mutual funds, hedge funds, securitizations, cryptocurrencies, just to name a few) and potential policy options in order to protect “Main Street” from “Wall Street”. Additionally, we will explore the manner in which modern finance has grown out of powerful theories, both mathematical and psychological. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>INTD 0210 Sophomore Seminar in the Liberal Arts (Fall 2022, Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The current pandemic, and all the questions it brings to the fore about what we value in a college experience, make this an ideal moment to consider the meaning and purpose of your liberal arts education. At the heart of this exploration will be a question posed by physicist Arthur Zajonc: “How do we find our own authentic way to an undivided life where meaning and purpose are tightly interwoven with intellect and action, where compassion and care are infused with insight and knowledge?” We will examine how, at this pivotal moment of decision making, you can understand your college career as an act of “cultivating humanity” and how you can meaningfully challenge yourself to take ownership of your intellectual and personal development. Through interdisciplinary and multicultural exploration, drawing from education studies and philosophical, religious, and literary texts, we will engage our course questions by way of student-led discussion, written reflection, and personal, experiential learning practices. In this way we will examine how a liberal arts education might foster the cultivation of an ‘undivided’ life, “the good life”, a life well-lived. (The course is open to sophomores and second semester first-year students. Juniors by permission only.)</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

		<h1>Program in International &amp; Global Studies</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>General Requirements</h2>
<p>A major must specialize in one of the following tracks: African Studies, East Asian Studies, European Studies, Latin American Studies, Middle East and North African Studies, Russian and East European Studies, South Asian Studies, Global Environmental Change, Global Gender and Sexuality Studies, Global Migration and Diaspora Studies or Global Security Studies. IGS majors may not double count any course, including required language courses, towards their regional or thematic specialization.</p>
<p><strong>Regardless of their track, all majors must complete the following:</strong> IGST 0101, five regional or thematic courses, three global courses for the regional tracks or three regional courses for the thematic tracks. Students must also study one of the non-English languages taught at Middlebury; study abroad for at least one semester (on a Middlebury Program); complete at least one advanced level language course upon return from abroad; and take a 0400 level IGST senior seminar.

<h3>Minors</h3>
<p>There is no IGS minor. However, IGS majors are strongly encouraged to minor in any department or program that offers a minor and can accommodate them, so long as they do not double-count any course. Students wishing to minor in the department that teaches the IGS language of their focus should discuss their minor with the IGS director.</p>
<h3>Specific Requirements</h3>
<p>All IGS majors are required to take IGST 0101 and are expected to do so before studying abroad. IGST 0101 is not open to seniors except for those who declared the major as sophomores and spent the fall semester of their junior year abroad. Students who declare their major as a sophomore but have not taken IGST 0101, and plan to study abroad for only one semester must take it in the fall of their junior year prior to going abroad.</p>
<h3>Language Study</h3>
<p>Students must become proficient in one of the languages that Middlebury College teaches. Individual language departments determine what level of study constitutes proficiency, and students are expected to do advanced work in their target language. All majors must take at least one advanced course in the language of study upon returning from abroad and are encouraged to take more than one. <strong>Students who, upon declaring the IGS major, have been determined proficient in one of their region’s languages will continue to take this language at the advanced level and are strongly recommended to take one year or equivalent of another language. The additional language should be chosen in consultation with the advisor.</strong></p>
<p>There are no language requirements for South Asian Studies majors or students who major in a thematic track but study abroad in India: these students must study a language when abroad, but are not expected to achieve language proficiency or complete an advanced language course once they return. Instead, these majors must take one additional regional or global course in their senior year.</p>
<h3>Language Study for East Asian Studies</h3>
<p>Students who already have native proficiency in Chinese must fulfill the language requirements for Japanese. Students who already have native proficiency in Japanese must fulfill the language requirements for Chinese. The Chairs of the Chinese and Japanese Studies departments or their designees determine what constitutes native proficiency by evaluating students individually through interviews or tests.</p>
<p>Note: for EAS majors whose language is Chinese, the language requirement is: (1) CHNS 0101-CHNS 0202 (strongly encouraged to attend Middlebury Chinese Summer School, or take CHNS 0301/0302); (2) one semester at one of the three Middlebury CV Starr Schools Abroad in China; and (3) one, preferably two, of the following: CHNS 0411, 0412, 0425, 0426, OR 0475 upon return from study abroad in China.</p>

<p>IGS majors must take five courses that correspond to their regional track, in at least three departments. See <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/international-global-studies/courses">the list of approved courses</a>. At least three regional courses must be taken at Middlebury. For East Asian Studies majors, at least three of the regional courses should be exclusively or primarily on the country that is the focus of language study, and at least one should be on East Asia as a region or the East Asian country that is not the focus of language study.</p>
<h3>Thematic Specialization</h3>
<p>IGS majors must take five courses that are specific to their track, in at least three departments. At least three thematic courses must be taken on the Middlebury College campus.</p>
<h3>Global Courses</h3>
<p>Students with regional specializations are required to take three global courses; only one can be at the 0100 level. Global courses are thematic, transregional, and/or comparative. They highlight the connectivity of places and stress the circulation and interaction of peoples, cultures, ideas, and other phenomena beyond state boundaries.</p>
<h3>Regional Courses for Thematic Tracks</h3>
<p>Students<strong> </strong>with thematic specialization are required to take three regional courses that correspond to their language of specialization. Except for students who study abroad an entire year, these courses must be taken on the Middlebury College campus.</p>
<h3>Study Abroad</h3>
<p>Students must study abroad for at least one semester (and preferably two) on a Middlebury-approved study abroad program in their region of focus. Study abroad must be in the language of study at Middlebury. Effective for the class of 2021, students who study abroad for one semester may count up to two courses and those who study abroad for a full year may count up to four courses toward the major. Major credit will be granted, pending approval, upon the student’s return from abroad. For regional courses, approval is granted by the track director and for global courses by the IGS director. Students should share the syllabi and all written work for all courses they wish to count with the track or program director, respectively.</p>
<h3>Advanced Placement</h3>
<p>Advanced Placement credit will not count toward the major.</p>

The language departments will determine which courses fulfill this requirement, in consultation with the program director. South Asian Studies majors or students who major in the thematic track and studied abroad in India do not take an upper-level language course, but rather, one additional regional or global course.</p>
<h3>Honors</h3>
<p>Students who seek to graduate with Honors may elect to write a two-term senior honors thesis. Students are eligible to write an honors thesis if they have a 3.5 GPA or better in all courses that count for the major. These include all language courses, all regional courses, all global courses, all courses taken abroad, and all courses with an IGST designation. Thesis grades do not count in the calculation of the GPA for honors. See <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/international-global-studies/student-resources/thesis-guidelines">thesis guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Honors are awarded to students with a GPA of 3.5 and a thesis grade of B+; high honors to students with a GPA of 3.7 and a thesis grade of A- or A; and highest honors to students with a GPA of 3.8 and a thesis grade of A.</p>

<p><strong>Regional Specialization</strong>: See Requirements above.</p>
<p><strong>Study Abroad</strong>: See Requirements above.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Program</strong>: See Senior Program above. <strong>Note:</strong> because Middlebury does not currently offer a South Asian language, students are not required to take an additional language course on their return from South Asia; instead, they must take one additional regional or global course.</p>
<h2>Global Environmental Change</h2>
<p>The planet is facing extraordinary challenges; among them are climate change, loss of biodiversity, environmental degradation, and the unequal distribution of critical resources. Indeed, the environmental challenges that the world now faces have never been more complex, posing greater threat to people around the globe. This track exposes students to the complex relationship between people and their environments at local, national and global scales. It highlights issues of social and environmental (in)justices as experienced cross-culturally, and the ways people have responded to and addressed environmental change.</p>
<p><strong>Language/Culture: </strong>See Language Study above. Because issues relating to the environment transcend countries and regions, majors may learn any language taught at Middlebury. Students wishing to study in programs that focus on Global Environmental Issues in an English-speaking country may do so, provided that they also study at least one semester on a Middlebury program in the region corresponding to their language.</p>
<p><strong>Track Requirements: </strong>Students must take 5 thematic courses from the list of approved courses. They must take one introductory course, two courses on environmental impact; one course on social (in)Justice and the environment; one course on responses and adaptation to environmental change. No more than one course can focus on the U.S, and not more than one course can be at the 400 level. Some courses are listed in more than one category. Courses cannot double count.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Some courses may have pre-requisites. These courses must be taken in at least three departments/interdisciplinary programs.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Requirements</strong>: See Senior Program above.</p>
<h2>Global Gender and Sexuality Studies</h2>
<p>Concerns pertaining to gender and sexuality, as well as how feminism is articulated around the world, have become central to the interdisciplinary project of international and global studies. The thematic cluster will be comprised of five courses, through which students can gain the knowledge and tools to bring feminist epistemologies to bear on their analyses of international and global issues. Scholars in feminist and queer studies—and in the subfields of postcolonial feminism and transnational queer studies, for example—have centralized the construction of space and place in ways that will be useful to IGS students. The cluster reflects the rigor of feminist and queer analyses of the global and international and is flexible enough to permit choices among students. The core GSFS courses will offer students the theory and methods needed for an engagement with global concerns, while the courses in the breadth requirements will enable an analysis of specific national/transnational courses. Since GSFS is an interdisciplinary program, the track reflects an interdisciplinary approach to questions of gender and sexuality</p>
<p><strong>Language/Culture: </strong>See Language Study above. </p>
<p><strong>Track Requirements: </strong>Students must take 5 thematic courses from the <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/international-global-studies/courses">list of approved courses</a>. They must take one introductory course (GSFS 0191, 0200, or 0289); Feminist Theory (GSFS 0320); one critical race studies course; and two transnational/national feminism courses, one of which should be taken during the study abroad semester.</p>
<p><strong>Study Abroad:  </strong>See Study Abroad above. At least one study abroad course should transfer as a GSFS elective that meets the national/transnational feminism breadth requirement. In the semester prior to studying abroad, the student should consult with the GSFS director to confirm the proposed course would transfer appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Requirements</strong>: See Senior Program above.</p>
<h2>Global Migration and Diaspora Studies</h2>
<p>Migrations and diasporas have shaped human political, economic and cultural interaction among diverse peoples across the globe for millennia. Migratory flows, whether forced or voluntary, shape the way individuals “imagine” and construct their communities. This thematic track equips students with the knowledge and tools to understand and analyze the multiple influences of migration and diaspora at a global, national and local scales. In addition to theories of migration and issues of rights, students will examine specific case studies that highlight topics such as justice, belonging, and the migrant experience. GMDS offers students powerful insights into diasporas, exiles, refugees and other types of migrations and the international laws and global forces that shape them. The program’s interdisciplinary and comparative perspectives will allow students to understand and participate in the rich debates around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Language/Culture: </strong>See Language Study above. </p>
<p><strong>Track Requirements: </strong>Students majoring in IGS/Migration and Diaspora Studies must take 5 thematic courses—in at least three departments across two divisions—from the list of approved courses.</p>
<ul><li>One Introductory course</li>
<li>Two courses in causes of population shifts</li>
<li>One course on race and ethnicity</li>
<li>One course the migrant’s experience</li>
</ul><p><strong>Study Abroad: </strong>All Global Migration and Diaspora Studies majors must study a foreign language and study abroad in at least one region corresponding to that language. Because issues relating to migration and diaspora transcend countries and regions, majors may learn any language taught at Middlebury. Students wishing to study in programs that focus on Migration Studies in an English-speaking environment may do so, provided that they also study at least one semester in the region corresponding to their language.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Requirements</strong>: See Senior Program above.</p>
<h2>Global Security Studies</h2>
<p>Security concerns are generated by a constellation of economic, political, historical, and environmental forces and are experienced at different scales—from the local to the global, and from the individual to the state. By drawing on courses from various departments, this track exposes students to security issues along three dimensions: global, international, and societal. The track highlights strategic concerns and issues of injustice, as well as the causes of insecurity over time and how it is experienced cross-culturally.</p>
<p><strong>Language/Culture: </strong>See Language Study above.</p>
<p><strong>Track Requirements: </strong>Students must take 5 thematic courses, in at least three departments and across two divisions. They must take one introductory course, two courses on international security issues, one course on societal security issues, and one course on global security issues. </p>
<p><strong>Study Abroad:  </strong>Security Studies majors must learn a foreign language and study abroad for at least one semester in the region corresponding to that language. Because security issues transcend countries and regions, majors may learn any language taught at Middlebury. Students who wish to study security issues abroad in an English language environment may do so, <em>provided</em> that they also study at least one semester in the region corresponding to their language.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Requirements:</strong> See Senior Program above.</p>

			<h3>IGST 0231 Political Economy of Contemporary India (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Seventy-five years since independence from the British, and three decades since the launch of the most ambitious set of economic reforms, India has changed dramatically over the years; but what does all this change really mean for the lives of ordinary citizens?   This course will explore the political economy context of India’s development, and in particular, the changing texture of democracy, economic transition from the state to the market, gender relations, environmental challenges, India's economic globalization, and a changing world view from the time of India's independence to the present.  The course will also capture the tensions inherent in such a multifaceted process of change. We will make use of historical texts and visual sources to map out how local and national economic, socio-political and cultural factors interweave with the global movement of people and ideas in the continued evolution of contemporary India.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>IGST 0237 The Origins of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">When did the Jewish-Arab conflict begin? This survey course considers several different moments of its birth, such as the 1880s first wave of Zionist immigrants to Palestine, the 1917 Balfour Declaration, the 1948 and 1967 war and the 1964 establishment of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and other landmark moments. Based on secondary literature and primary textual and visual materials, we will engage with these competing periodizations and analyze various Israeli and Palestinian historical narratives they embody, considering broader themes such as the relations between the historian’s identity and the production of historical narratives, and the dynamic between facts, narratives and ideologies. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">The course approaches the history of modern Jerusalem through the lens of intercultural encounters. Based on primary historical sources and secondary literature, we will examine how the relations between Muslims, Christians, and Jews transformed as the city changed hands between the Ottomans, British, Jordanians, and Israelis. The introductory units will discuss the making of multi-cultural Jerusalem in the late Ottoman period and how, under British rule (1917-1948), its cosmopolitanism was abated by nationalism. We will then discuss its partition following the 1948 War and the emergence of “West Jerusalem” and “East Jerusalem.” Proceeding past 1967, we will examine if and to what extent Jerusalem became an integrated, united city under Israel sovereignty before concluding with a discussion of contemporary trends.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to Latin America and Latin American studies. It introduces key debates on the region (and its many subregions) that will feature prominently in other courses not only at Middlebury, but also study abroad. By tracing the region’s historical development, we closely examine issues such as colonialism, economics, identity, imperialism, modes of citizenry, and nationalism, as well as explore how class, commerce, culture, ethnicity, gender, politics, race, religion, and sexuality have come to be understood in Latin America and its study. Critical, scholarly, and theoretical readings will supplement primary texts. 3 hrs. Lect./disc</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will learn to identify, describe, classify, analyze, solve, and make predictions about the world’s most pressing problems. Using the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a framework, we will select specific issues and learn to compare and connect across them to establish their interconnectedness and complexity. Students will then conduct independent research, collaborate with classmates across disciplines, and use a variety of approaches to come up with innovative solutions to issues most pressing to them. Lectures, class discussions, in-class group work, and oral presentations will guide students’ learning while self-study reports, group oral presentations and issue papers, individual written reflections, and class participation will be used to gauge student learning. By the end of the course, students will be proficient in collaborative problem assessment and problem solving across a variety of global issues.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>IGST 0354 Postcolonial Literature, Migrants and the City (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course, we will analyze postcolonial literature that portrays the lives of migrants in cities. Postcolonial novels such as <em>Brick Lane</em> by Monica Ali, <em>Love Enough</em> by Dionne Brand, <em>Brother</em> by David Chariandi, <em>The Inheritance</em> of Loss by Kiran Desai, <em>Carnival</em> by Rawi Hage, <em>The Lonely Londoners</em> by Sam Selvon and <em>A Free Man</em> by Aman Sethi present counter-hegemonic narratives and visions of the city. They show that the city, indelibly marked by relations of Empire and the product of racial capitalism, is also a battleground for decoloniality: a delinking from colonial knowledge practices. To map this insurgent knowledge in postcolonial novels of the city, we will focus on four prominent themes that also serve as analytical categories: mobility, labor, conviviality, and protest.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Examples from politics, business, and community organization around the world will guide our inquiry, help us evaluate the quality of leadership affecting us and others, and enable us to assess our own leadership potential. To achieve these course goals, we will analyze real-world examples of good and poor leadership from around the world, compare across leadership cases, and assess leadership examples against theories of leadership in business, political science, history, and psychology. Class discussions, in-class simulations, short lectures, individual research projects, and oral presentations will inform our learning experience while reflection papers, individual research projects, individual oral presentations, and class participation will help gauge student learning.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>IGST 0414 Economic Development: Development /as/ Freedom (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Much of the world still faces the daily pain of poverty and inequality. Developing countries have to accelerate their growth rates, eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities, create productive employment, and address pressing environmental concerns. We will examine the major analytic and policy issues raised by these challenges and study the need for a productive balance between market forces and positive state action. We will pursue this against the backdrop of Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen’s path breaking work, <em>“Development as Freedom”</em> and bring in case studies from Asia, Latin America and Africa.  We will focus on different development strategies adopted, choice of policy instruments, methods of implementation, all the while asking if development is indeed an integrated process of expansion of substantive human freedoms that connect with one another for a higher purpose.

			<span class="course_description">After years of expansion since the end of the cold war, democracy now is in retreat. From young democracies in the developing world to bastions of liberal democracy in Western Europe and North America, democratic political systems are under mounting pressure. What are the fundamental features of this recession? What are the driving forces behind global democratic backsliding? Why do people support autocrats? In this course we will tackle these questions and discuss an array of factors that contribute to global democratic recession including the role of the political elite, failing institutions, eroding norms, and the role of ordinary people. In so doing we will delve deeper into economic and social causes of this decline. Our focus will span from global trends to individual cases such as Venezuela, Turkey, Hungary, India, the United States, and the Philippines. (Not open to students who have taken FYSE 1544) 3 hrs. Sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>IGST 0436 Terrorism (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Terrorism has taken on new dimensions in an age dominated by technology and mass media. It has continued to cause carnage as terrorists around the globe continue to resist violently real or perceived oppression. In this course we will examine the breeding grounds for terrorist activities and interrogate the global connections behind local and national extremist/terrorist groups. We will explore ethno-national and religious terrorist groups from Asia, Europe, and Latin America, and probe white supremacist groups in the U.S. The aim of the course is to develop critical understanding of the phenomenon of terrorism, the local-global connections, and the challenges associated with terrorism in the 21st century. 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>IGST 0483 The Rise of Asia and US Policy (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will study what is arguably the most important strategic development of the 21st century: how the rise of Asia presents security challenges to the region and the United States. Drawing from international relations scholarship, the course will focus on foreign policy challenges and potential responses. These challenges include both traditional security and nontraditional  areas such as water and the environment. We will integrate the analysis of these issues in South, East, and Southeast Asia with study of the policy process, in part  through simulations and role-playing exercises. 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

		<h1>Program in International Politics and Economics</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>Courses in Political Science</h2>
<p>PSCI 0103, PSCI 0109, PSCI/IPEC 0304 and three electives in comparative politics or international relations. At least one elective should be a 0400-level senior seminar in comparative politics or international relations. See <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/international-politics-economics/courses#midd-course-list-label-13489">eligible electives</a>. PSCI/IPEC 0304 must be taken at Middlebury College. Majors are encouraged to take IPEC 0240 prior to PSCI/IPEC 0304.</p>
<h2>Courses in Economics</h2>
<p>ECON 0150 <strong>or</strong> ECON 0250 (only one will count towards this requirement), ECON 0155 <strong>or</strong> ECON 0255 (only one will count towards this requirement), ECON 0210, IPEC0240 (formerly ECON 0240) and two electives with an international orientation. One elective should be a 0400-level senior seminar. See <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/international-politics-economics/courses#midd-course-list-label-13488">eligible electives</a>. Majors must take a minimum of five courses in economics, regardless of credits earned at the secondary level (see the Advanced Placement policy for detailed information); at least four economics courses meeting the major requirements must be taken at Middlebury College, including the 0400-level seminar. Majors are encouraged to take IPEC 0240 prior to PSCI/IPEC 0304. Majors are strongly encouraged to take ECON 210 prior to any 400-level seminars.</p>
<h2>Language Study</h2>
<p>Majors must achieve the language department’s standard of linguistic competence before going abroad or must demonstrate equivalent competence in a language taught at Middlebury College through a language placement exam. Foreign language study while at Middlebury College is strongly encouraged.</p>
<h2>Term or Year Abroad</h2>
<p>Under normal circumstances, this will be completed at one of the Middlebury schools abroad. Majors should complete PSCI 0103, PSCI 0109, ECON 0150 <strong>or</strong> ECON 0250, ECON 0155 <strong>or</strong> ECON 0255, and ECON 0210 before going abroad. Majors are encouraged, but not required, to take IPEC 0240 and PSCI/IPEC 0304 before studying abroad.</p>
<p>Given the extraordinary circumstances around the pandemic, the IPE faculty have agreed to waive the study abroad requirement for the classes of 2021, 2021.5, 2022, 2022.5 and 2023 irrespective of reason. Should the study abroad programs run and IPE majors participate, majors will still be able to apply for transfer credits in the usual manner. Students whose programs are cancelled or who opt to remain at Middlebury are encouraged, but not required, to take courses at Middlebury that might provide some engagement with the region of focus originally intended. This might include taking an additional upper-level language course (e.g., 300 level or higher), a course specifically about the region in any department or pursue an independent study with a regional focus. The IPE program will also consider summer study abroad transfer credits, for the classes of 2021.5 and 2022 only, that meet the College’s requirements for credit and are sufficiently relevant to International Politics and Economics for majors who pursued a study abroad experience in the summer of 2021</p>
<h2>Advanced Placement</h2>
<p>Students must take a minimum of 5 courses in each discipline. See the <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/international-politics-economics/courses/advanced-placement">Advanced Placement</a> policy for detailed information.</p>
<h2>Winter Term Courses</h2>
<p>Winter Term courses count towards the major only if they are listed on the <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/international-politics-economics/courses">IPEC Courses</a> prior to winter term registration. No more than one Winter Term elective in economics and no more than one Winter Term elective in political science may count toward the major.</p>
<h2>Double Majors and Minors</h2>
<p>Because of the complex and interdisciplinary nature of the International Politics and Economics major, IPE students are strongly advised not to pursue an additional major. In addition, IPEC majors may not minor in either economics or political science. Students are permitted to major or minor in their language of focus for the IPE major; however, they may not double count courses for the IP&amp;E major and the language major or minor</p>
<h2>Declaring a Major</h2>
<p>To declare a major, students need to fill out both a <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/office/registrar/forms">major declaration form</a> and an <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/international-politics-economics/student-resources/advising-wizard">advising wizard form</a>. Discuss your plan for completing the major (outlined on the advising wizard form) with your advisor who can be from either the political science or economics department. Have both your advisor and the Director of International Politics and Economics sign the major declaration form. Turn in one copy of <em>both forms</em> to the coordinator of International Politics and Economics. Turn in one copy of the <em>major declaration form</em> to the Registrar’s Office.</p>
<h2>First Semester Senior Year</h2>
<p>Early in the first semester of your senior year, fill out both a <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/office/registrar/forms">degree audit sheet</a> and an <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/international-politics-economics/student-resources/advising-wizard">advising wizard form</a>. Print out a copy of your unofficial transcript and evidence that any courses from abroad have been approved for IPE major credit (such as an email approval from a chair or director, or information from the programs abroad office). Bring these items to the Director of International Politics and Economics no later than a week before registration for classes for your final semester. Once signed, turn in one copy of the<em> advising wizard form</em> and the <em>degree audit sheet</em> to the coordinator of International Politics and Economics. Turn in one copy of the <em>degree audit sheet</em> to the Registrar’s Office.</p>
<h2>Honors</h2>
<p>In addition to their 12 required courses, qualifying students can choose to write a senior thesis. To launch a thesis project, students must obtain a thesis advisor in both political science and economics, and submit to their advisors a thesis prospectus for formal approval. To identify suitable thesis topics, it is highly recommended that IPE thesis candidates begin consulting with the potential advisors during their junior year. For details, deadlines, and a timetable, see the <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/international-politics-economics/student-resources/honors-thesis">Honors Thesis page</a>.</p>
<h2>Honors Thesis Requirements</h2>
<p>The determination of honors, high honors, and highest honors is based on the following:</p>
<ul><li>The level of the grade achieved on the thesis.</li>
<li>The level of the average grade received in all Middlebury College courses that count toward the IPE major.</li>
</ul><p>Honors candidates must have the following:</p>
<ul><li>An IPEC course average of 3.3 and a thesis grade of B+ to attain honors.</li>
<li>An IPEC course average of at least 3.5 and a thesis grade of A- to attain high honors.</li>
<li>An IPEC course average of at least 3.7 and a thesis grade of A to attain highest honors.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>Thesis grades do not count in the calculation of the GPA for honors, and a thesis cannot be pursued as a fifth course during any term.</p>

		<a href="#top" class="jump_link">↑ Top</a>
		<h1>Department of Italian</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><p>During the academic year our program emphasizes the study of literature and culture in the context of language acquisition. The other integral components of Italian at Middlebury are the Italian School (summer on the Middlebury College campus or at our satellite campus at Mills College, in Oakland, California), and the C. V. Starr-Middlebury College School in Italy (junior year or semester), where students can take courses in our beautiful Sede in Florence, or can direct-enroll in our programs at the University of Firenze, the University of Ferrara, or the University of Rome, La Sapienza. These rich programs encourage students to deepen and broaden their study of Italian literature, cinema, history, art history, political science, and many other disciplines. During the academic year in Middlebury, all four levels of courses in Italian are available every semester, and—for qualified students—faculty members are also available to direct independent research projects (ITAL 0550).</p>
<h2>Major in Italian</h2>
<p>For a full or double major in Italian, students must complete nine credits beyond ITAL 0103, including independent senior work (ITAL 0755). Please note: ITAL 0101, 0102, and 0103 do not count for the major. The standard curriculum includes: two courses at the 200-level (0251 and 0252); three credits abroad plus one course at the 300-level at Middlebury (or four courses at the 300-level); two courses at the 400-level (but only one for students who spend a whole year in Italy); ITAL 0755 (your capstone course, can be a research project such an essay, or a creative work such as a Podcast or a video). Majors are normally expected to study at least one semester at one of the three sites of the C.V. Starr-Middlebury College School in Italy: Florence, Ferrara or Rome. No more than three credits per semester from Study Abroad in Italy are applicable to the major. Upon return from Italy, students normally take an Italian course each semester.  A student can complete major requirements at all levels with courses taken at the Middlebury Summer Italian School. One credit towards the Major can be fulfilled by successfully taking a course in English with an approved section in Italian (History of the Italian Language; Italian Cinema; Italy Through Sicily).</p>
<h2>Joint Major in Italian</h2>
<p>For the joint major in Italian, students must complete seven credits beginning with ITAL 0251, including one course at the 0400 level. Students must also complete a joint project credited in either of the two disciplines, as well as fulfill the requirements in the second discipline. Students are normally expected to complete one semester at either the C.V. Starr-Middlebury College School in Florence, the University of Firenze, the University of Ferrara, or the University of Rome, La Sapienza. No more than three credits per semester from coursework in Italy are applicable to the Italian part of the major.</p>
<h2>International and Global Studies Major with Italian</h2>
<p><strong><em>(European Studies Track)</em></strong></p>
<p>Along with other required courses and senior work as described in the International and Global Studies major section, the Italian language component of an International and Global Studies major requires completion of the following: 1) Italian courses required for study in Italy (see below); 2) one semester, and preferably a full year, at the C.V. Starr-Middlebury College School in Florence, the University of Ferrara, or the University of Rome; 3) at least one 0400-level course in Italian upon return from Italy. Regional specialization requirements for the International and Global Studies major may include ITAL 0290-level courses (in English) as well as 0300-level courses taught at Middlebury or in Italy.</p>
<h2>Minor in Italian</h2>
<p>The Italian minor consists of six courses: ITAL 0251, ITAL 0252 (or two courses counted from ITAL 3251-3252-3253 in the Italian Summer School) and four courses at the 0300-level or higher. Students entering the program with a standing beyond the ITAL 0252-level are required to take at least one 0400-level course as part of the Italian minor. All courses at the 0300-level can be completed during the academic year at Middlebury, at the Italian School, or at one of the affiliated Middlebury programs in Italy (Florence, Ferrara, or Rome).</p>
<h2>Senior Work</h2>
<p>Students who major in Italian are required to complete a senior project (ITAL 0755).</p>
<h2>Honors</h2>
<p>To earn departmental honors, high honors*, or highest honors** a student must have at least a 3.6, 3.7*, or 3.8** average or above in Italian courses other than the senior project, have a project defense, and receive a grade of at least B+, A-*, or A** on the thesis (ITAL 0755).</p>
<h2>Fulfilling The Middlebury College Writing Requirement</h2>
<p>All Italian majors, joint majors, minors, and International and Global Studies majors with literature and culture focus in Italian are strongly encouraged to fulfill their college writing requirement by enrolling in CMLT 0101 Introduction to World Literature.</p>
<h2>Requirements for Junior Year/Semester Abroad</h2>
<p>The Italian language proficiency requirements for participation in study abroad in Italy can be completed with any combination of courses at the Middlebury campus (summer or academic year) that culminates with the successful completion of ITAL 0252 during the academic year or ITAL 3253 at the Summer School. Students must also have an overall academic average of at least B-, an average of B in Italian (or additional course work), and be enrolled in an Italian course the semester before departure. Because of the demanding and intensive nature of our programs in Middlebury, and because of the difficulty of finding equivalent programs in the United States or in Italy, we do not accept alternative programs for the fulfillment of study abroad requirements.</p>
<h2>C.V. Starr-Middlebury School in Italy-Florence</h2>
<p>Students may study for a semester or for a full year in Italy. Fall and spring term students enroll for language, literature, and civilization courses in September and January. For examples of recent courses, please refer to the course database: <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/international/sa/cid">http://www.middlebury.edu/international/sa/cid</a>.  Students studying in Florence are also expected to enroll in at least two elective courses at the Università degli Studi di Firenze. Subject areas generally offered there include archeology, philology, Italian literature, linguistics, international relations, political science, comparative politics, sociology, history, art history, and history of economics.</p>
<h2>C.V. Starr-Middlebury School in Italy-Ferrara/Rome</h2>
<p>Students who apply to the programs at the University of Ferrara or the University of Rome must contact the department chair to discuss their plans. Important: All students studying at the University of Ferrara or the University of Rome must take a literature course, in consultation with the department chair. Subject areas often offered include Italian literature, comparative literature, history, linguistics, philosophy, geography, art history, architecture, theater history, sociology, and international economics as well as other disciplines.</p>

			<h3>ITAL 0101 Beginning Italian (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">This course is an introduction to the Italian language that provides a foundation in both spoken and written Italian.

<p>The major requires students to achieve proficiency in Japanese language and culture. In addition, students must study in Japan for at least one semester and complete a 0400-level seminar in the Japanese Studies department.</p>
<h3>Proficiency in Japanese Language</h3>
<p>Proficiency in Japanese language requires four years of study (completion of JAPN 0402) or equivalent with at least 4 semesters of language at Middlebury in cases of advanced placement. To meet the language proficiency requirement, students are strongly encouraged to begin the study of Japanese in their first academic year. Students who begin study of Japanese in the sophomore year must attend the summer Middlebury School of Japanese or achieve completion of the equivalent of JAPN0202 before study abroad in Japan.</p>
<h3>Proficiency in Culture</h3>
<p>Proficiency in culture requires a total of five elective content courses. At least three of the content courses must come from those offered by the department, while two may come from courses taken during study abroad or courses with a focus on Japan taught in other departments at the College (History, Religion, History of Art, etc.) and cross-listed in Japanese Studies. Departmental courses fulfilling the elective content course requirement include all courses below the 0400-level taught by the department in English.  At least two elective content courses must be taken before approval for study in Japan.  (One of the two courses may be one of the Japan-focused content courses cross-listed in the department.)</p>
<h3>Studying in Japan</h3>

			<h3>JWST 0160 Jewish Traditions (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">“Traditions” are not static, but a constant interplay between continuity and creativity.  What do classical Jewish texts (Bible, Rabbinic literature) tell us about Judaism’s origins?  How have the core concepts and practices of Judaism morphed into a cluster of traditions that has endured over two millennia? With these questions in mind, we will study central ideas in Jewish thought, rituals, and their transformations, culminating in individual projects involving the investigation a contemporary movement, congregation or trend in contemporary Jewish life, e.g. Reform, Reconstructionism, mystical (neo-Kabbalistic) revivals, or “secular” Judaism. 3 hrs. lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>JWST 0231 Zionism and the "Roads Not Taken" (1880-1948) (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">An Arab-Jewish binational state in Palestine was only one of the possible paths that the Zionist movement considered before taking the road that led to Israel’s 1948 establishment. Using various primary and secondary sources, we will critically engage with alternatives to the nation-state within the Zionist movement, unfolding key debates in its history. In the introductory units, we will position Zionism alongside other forms of Jewish nationalism, such as Simon Dubnow’s Diaspora Nationalism. We will then zoom in on post-World War I Zionism, discussing Imperial, anti-Imperial, pan-Asian, and binationalist-federalist alternatives to the Jewish nation-state program. In the concluding units, we will examine the processes by which these possibilities became marginalized, and the vision of a Jewish nation-state prevailed.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>JWST 0330 Jewish Oral History (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this weekly seminar students will learn the basics of oral history—research, interview skills, processing, archiving, and presentation—by conducting interviews with members of Kolot Chayeinu, a Brooklyn-based Jewish congregation. Students will work with congregants to create an oral history archive. Depending on student interests and abilities, additional outcomes may include films, audiowalks, social media presence, listening parties, or podcasts. Students will also study oral history theory, the evolution of American Jewish spirituality, and New York City social movements. An oral history of Kolot encompasses Jewish histories of feminism, LGBTQ and AIDS activism, peace and human rights work, death and dying, childhood and adult education, antiracism, theatre, art, music, nonprofit development, politics, rabbinical training, coalition work, and more.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>JWST 0388 The Book of Job and the Problem of Evil (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Why do the innocent suffer? The Book of Job asked this question millennia ago, giving not an explicit answer, but at least a response. Framed by a prose tale on the patient Job, the book is mainly a debate in poetry between an impatient Job and his “friends” that has continued to our day, in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thought, and in philosophy. We will study the debate on the meaning of Job in philosophy and religion through the works of Maimonides, Kant, Hume, Voltaire, William Blake, Jung, and others. Familiarity with Biblical studies or philosophy of religion is helpful, but not required. 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">Feminism has a rich history in the United States. In this course we will study feminism from the perspectives of two distinct, sometimes intersecting groups: Black Americans and Jewish Americans. We will explore major feminist texts, writers, and collectives, from Angela Davis, bell hooks, Audre Lorde, and the Combahee River Collective to Shulamith Firestone, Judith Plaskow, B’Not Esh, and Di Vilde Chayes. Through their work and activism, we will study in this reading-intensive course how race, class, spirituality, and sexuality have shaped and reshaped feminist concerns. 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HEBM 0234 Contemporary Israel: The Politics of Ethnic Difference (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The course explores the politics of ethnic difference in Israel through a combined historical-sociological perspective, using diverse textual and visual materials. After tracing the origins of the ethnic categories of “Ashkenazi” (Western) and Mizrachi (Middle Eastern/North African) Jews, we examine the history of immigration to Israel in the 1950s, considering how ethnicity came to define class and geography. In subsequent units, we will deal with Mizrachi protest movements such as the Israeli 1970s “Black Panthers” and the more recent trend of Mizrachi intellectuals to reclaim the “Arab-Jew” identity, and in comparison, the Mizrachi traditional support of hawkish positions regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the concluding units, we will utilize comparative tools to conceptualize this internal Jewish dynamic.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HEBM 0237 The Origins of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">When did the Jewish-Arab conflict begin? This survey course considers several different moments of its birth, such as the 1880s first wave of Zionist immigrants to Palestine, the 1917 Balfour Declaration, the 1948 and 1967 war and the 1964 establishment of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and other landmark moments. Based on secondary literature and primary textual and visual materials, we will engage with these competing periodizations and analyze various Israeli and Palestinian historical narratives they embody, considering broader themes such as the relations between the historian’s identity and the production of historical narratives, and the dynamic between facts, narratives and ideologies. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>HEBM 0238 Intercultural Jerusalem (1850-Present) (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The course approaches the history of modern Jerusalem through the lens of intercultural encounters. Based on primary historical sources and secondary literature, we will examine how the relations between Muslims, Christians, and Jews transformed as the city changed hands between the Ottomans, British, Jordanians, and Israelis. The introductory units will discuss the making of multi-cultural Jerusalem in the late Ottoman period and how, under British rule (1917-1948), its cosmopolitanism was abated by nationalism. We will then discuss its partition following the 1948 War and the emergence of “West Jerusalem” and “East Jerusalem.” Proceeding past 1967, we will examine if and to what extent Jerusalem became an integrated, united city under Israel sovereignty before concluding with a discussion of contemporary trends.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>LNGT 0102 Introduction to Sociolinguistics (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course, we will explore the ways that language creates and reflects social identities.  We will look at the contextual factors-social, cultural, geographical, political, etc.-that impact language use and variation.  Themes for this course will include linguistic variation, language and identity, language policy, and language in the media.  We will consider questions such as:  What distinguishes a language from a dialect?  How and why do some language varieties become privileged?   How do notions of politeness and respect vary across linguistic contexts?  In essence, we will learn how language shapes our world, and how we shape language itself.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>LNGT 0110 English Grammar: Concepts and Controversies (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will study the structure of the English language, learning key terms and strategies for analyzing English syntax.  We will explore English grammar from both prescriptive and descriptive perspectives and examine its relevance to language policy, linguistic prejudice, and English education.  Readings will be drawn from a variety of texts, including <em>Rhetorical Grammar</em> (2009), <em>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</em> (2006), <em>Language Myths</em> (1999), and <em>Origins of the Specious</em> (2010). This course is relevant to students wanting to increase their own knowledge of the English language, as well as to those seeking tools for English teaching and/or research.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>LNGT 0125 Language Structure and Function (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will discuss the major issues and findings in the study of human language within theories of modern linguistics, which shares a history with mid-century American anthropology. The main topics include the nature of human language in comparison with other communication systems; sound patterns (phonology); word-formation (morphology); sentence structure (syntax); meaning (semantics); use (pragmatics); language acquisition and socialization. We will also consider language variation and the historical development of languages.  Instruction is in English but examples will be drawn from less commonly studied languages around the world.

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will consider questions such as: What linguistic strategies do the news media use to craft compelling stories?  What are the dominant narratives at play about national and global social issues, and how are some journalists working to counter those narratives?  We will employ Critical Discourse Analysis as a central framework, reading theoretical and empirical work by linguists such as Teun van Dijk, as well as from sociologists and political scientists. We will engage with “On the Media” and other podcasts, TED talks, documentaries such as Outfoxed (2004), and online magazines.  Students will write for a variety of audiences. 3 hrs. lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Through the exploration of a language that is very different from Indo-European languages, students will gain a better understanding of how human languages work and are structured. The relationship of language to culture will be a central theme in the course. Topics covered will include key concepts in linguistics, Japanese linguistics, culture, and pedagogy. This course will be taught in English; no Japanese language or linguistics knowledge required. 3 hrs. lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>LNGT 0226 The Sounds of Language: Introduction to Phonetics and Phonology (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will study the description and analysis of speech: how the sounds of language are physiologically produced, acoustically represented, and psychologically perceived and categorized. Through acoustic and phonological analysis, students will develop the skills to distinguish and produce the sounds of the world’s languages, as well as explore the sound systems of different languages, in order to determine which patterns differ and which patterns are common to all. Students will hone their analytical and technical skills by solving phonological problem sets as well as by using computer software (Praat) to analyze the acoustics of speech. 3 hrs. lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>LNGT 0250 The Structure of Language: Introduction to Morphology and Syntax (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will focus on two fundamental areas in the study of language structure: morphology and syntax. Morphology is the study of the internal structure of words and their meaningful parts (e.g., roots and affixes), whereas syntax studies how words are combined to form larger units (phrases and sentences). Linguistic data for illustration and analysis will be taken both from English and a variety of languages belonging to different language families to help us better understand the unity and diversity of human language with regard to word and sentence structure. The course is intended to enhance students’ skills in linguistic description and analysis, as well as general problem-solving and analytical reasoning skills.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>LNGT 0270 Chinese Sociolinguistics (taught in English) (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Sociolinguistics is mainly concerned with the interaction of language and society. The language situation in China is unique both in the modern world and in human history. We will gain a good understanding of sociolinguistics as a scientific field of inquiry through exploring the Chinese situation in this course. Some of the questions we will ask are: What is Mandarin (Modern Standard) Chinese? Who are "native speakers" of Mandarin? Are most Chinese people monolingual (speaking only one language) or bilingual (speaking two languages) or even multilingual? How many "dialects" are there in China? What is the difference between a "language" and a "dialect"? Are Chinese characters "ideographs", i.e., "pictures" that directly represent meaning and have nothing to do with sound? Why has the pinyin romanization system officially adopted in the 1950s never supplanted the Chinese characters? Why are there traditional and simplified characters? We will also explore topics such as power, register, verbal courtesy, gender and language use. Students are encouraged to compare the Chinese situation with societies that they are familiar with.

			<h3>LNGT 0310 Variation and Change in Japanese (In English) (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">What can linguistic change tell us about human cognition and behavior? How does the notion of “politeness” vary across communities? How do speakers of Japanese perform gender and other social identities?  In this course we will address linguistic diversity and dynamism by examining the Japanese language. Topics include workplace discourse and change in honorific systems. Employing classic works in linguistics and addressing contemporary cultural materials such as manga and J-drama we will apply theoretical frameworks from (socio-)pragmatics, historical linguistics and linguistic typology to gain a deeper understanding of how and why Japanese has developed to its present forms and uses. Students with an interest in linguistics, or in teaching and learning language, or science in general, may also enjoy the analytical approach. (No prerequisites. JAPN0103 above or equivalent recommended). Heritage speakers are also welcome. 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>LNGT 0354 Philosophy of Language (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Speaking a language is a complex form of behavior that plays a rich and varied role in human life. The philosophy of language seeks to give a philosophical account of this phenomenon, focusing on such questions as: How does language gain meaning? How does it differ from animal communication? Is language in some sense innate? Other topics to be addressed include: theories of reference and truth; the relation between language, thought, and reality; and theories of metaphor. Readings from philosophers and linguists will include works by Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Chomsky, and Pinker.

		<h1>Program in Literary Studies</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>Required for the Major</h2>
<p>The overall design of the program is simple, and its expectations are clearly defined. This is a program of study designed for students who by the time of their graduation from Middlebury wish to secure a comprehensive background in a full range of major achievements of world literature, as well as an ability to read and appreciate works of literature in at least one language other than English.</p>
<p>To accomplish those ends, each Literary Studies major is required to take a total of 15 courses in literature over the course of four years. No more than six of these courses may be taken within a single department, and the individual courses may be selected from the literature of any language and of any period. They can be wide-ranging surveys or courses devoted to the study of single authors.</p>
<p>The specific selection of courses is entirely up to the student, but in order to fulfill the requirements for the major, he or she will be expected to take the following:</p>
<ul><li>Two courses—one historical, one generally theoretical in orientation—selected from the list specified below under the “Summary of Major Requirements”</li>
<li>One literature course in a foreign language (including Greek and Latin)—normally 0300-level (though FREN 0210 and the FREN 0200-series will usually qualify); and</li>
<li>A Colloquium for majors to be taken during the fall semester of the senior year.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, in conjunction with an independent reading course taken during the fall semester of the senior year, the student will arrange to take a one-hour oral examination in an area of specialization (as described below) that he or she has defined. This oral examination takes place at the end of the fall semester, and it is followed by a five-hour written comprehensive examination at the end of winter term.  The written examination will require the student to demonstrate a knowledge of a range of major works by the authors listed below. For reasons of practicality, the number of authors from this list whose works students will actually have an opportunity to discuss on the comprehensive examination in any given year will be limited to 12. </p>
<h2>Range of Authors</h2>
<p>The following current list will give the student a clear sense of the particular range of major authors it is presumed that he or she will be familiar with by senior year:</p>
<ul><li>Homer</li>
<li>Aeschylus</li>
<li>Sophocles</li>
<li>Vergil</li>
<li>Ovid</li>
<li>Lucretius</li>
<li>Dante</li>
<li>Boccaccio</li>
<li>Pirandello</li>
<li>Cervantes</li>
<li>Tirso de Molina</li>
<li>Calderón</li>
<li>Lope de Vega</li>
<li>Borges</li>
<li>Moliere</li>
<li>Baudelaire</li>
<li>Proust</li>
<li>Goethe</li>
<li>Kafka</li>
<li>Mann</li>
<li>Wang Wei</li>
<li>Cáo Xuegin</li>
<li>Lu-Xùn</li>
<li>Gogol</li>
<li>Dostoevsky</li>
<li>Tolstoy</li>
<li>Shakespeare</li>
<li>Milton</li>
<li>Wordsworth</li>
<li>Joyce</li>
<li>Emerson</li>
<li>Melville</li>
<li>Faulkner</li>
<li>Murasaki Shikibu</li>
<li>Chikamatsu Monzaemon</li>
<li>Natsume Soseki</li>
</ul><p>In addition to works by authors whose names appear on this primary list, Literary Studies majors will be urged to deepen their general cultural background by becoming acquainted with the Old and New Testaments (especially Genesis, Psalms, Job, Song of Songs, Matthew, John, Revelation, and the Epistle to the Romans), as well as principal works of Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, Darwin, Marx, and Freud. A full list of the specific works by these authors included on the current Literary Studies comprehensive reading list is available on the Literary Studies Program website, or from the directors of the program.</p>
<p>Beyond the two historical and theoretical courses required for the program (both of which are counted toward the major), the 0300-level foreign language literature course, the senior year colloquium (LITS 0705) and independent reading course (LITS 0701), and the total of 15 courses, the general, defining requirement for the Literary Studies major is the winter term comprehensive examination (LITS 0700), the overall range of which is specified in the comprehensive reading list. In the process of working toward this general literary education, the student will also be expected to use the independent reading course (LITS 0701) to focus on a group of works chosen to represent an individual specialization in the literature of a particular culture (e.g., German, English, American, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, etc.), or period (e.g., the eighteenth century, the twentieth century, etc.), or genre (e.g., the novel, the drama, lyric poetry, etc.). The specific authors and the 10 to 12 texts selected by the student for this specialization will be approved by the director in conjunction with two faculty examiners with relevant expertise in the fields represented. This oral examination is the culmination of the independent reading course (LITS 0701) in the fall semester. At the end of the following winter term, there is a five-hour written winter term comprehensive examination based on the reading list. Students qualifying for honors (a B+ average in the major, including the comprehensive examination) will complete a Senior Honors Essay (LITS 0710) in their final semester.</p>
<p>After completing all the specified requirements, the student will be graduated from Middlebury College as a Literary Studies major with a particular area of interest: for example, epic poetry, European drama, Japanese literature, the literature of the nineteenth century, etc. Should the student wish to pursue graduate study, depending on the nature of his or her interests and preparation, the student would be in a good position to do so in such fields as English or American literature, comparative literature, or the literature of a specific foreign language; in addition, he or she would have a secure background for further studies in such fields as law, political philosophy, religion, journalism, publishing, medicine, and cultural and intellectual history.  Literary Studies majors have gone on to do work in all these areas.</p>
<p>As indicated above, students will be eligible for departmental honors in Literary Studies if in their combined performance in literature courses and on the two parts of the comprehensive examination they have achieved an average grade of B+ or higher. Honors will be awarded on the basis of the overall grade average in the major, performance on the comprehensive examination, and a senior honors essay of 30-40 pages to be completed during the spring semester of the senior year (this project counts as one course). A one-hour oral examination on the content and implications of this honors essay is also required, and this examination will be conducted by two faculty members with particular expertise in the fields represented.</p>
<h2>Summary of Major Requirements</h2>
<p>Total of 15 courses (no more than six in any one department).</p>
<p><strong>(1) </strong>Two courses selected from the historical and theoretical courses listed below, one from each category, as currently offered. (With the permission of the director, alternative courses may be substituted for those specified here.)</p>
<p><strong>Historical</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>CLAS 0150 Greek and Roman Epic</li>
<li>CLAS 0152 Greek Tragedy</li>
<li>RELI 0180 Introduction to Biblical Literature</li>
<li>PSCI 0101 Introduction to Political Science</li>
</ul><p><strong>Theoretical</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>ENAM 0205 Contemporary Literary Theory</li>
</ul><p><strong>(2)</strong> One course in literature in a foreign language (normally 0300 level, but FREN 0201 and FREN 0220 series would usually qualify).</p>
<p><strong>(3) </strong>At least four literature courses, but no more than six, to be taken within a single department. (Courses in language instruction may not be counted toward this requirement.)</p>
<p><strong>(4)</strong> Independent Reading Course (LITS 0701) in Area of Specialization (by genre, period, theme, or national literature), an area of particular interest  defined by the student in consultation with the director. A one-hour oral examination, to be taken in the fall semester before the winter term written comprehensive examination in the senior year, is devoted to this area of special interest. The 10 to12 texts required for this examination will be chosen by the student in conjunction with the director and two faculty examiners with appropriate backgrounds in the fields represented.</p>
<p><strong>(5) </strong>Senior Colloquium for majors (LITS 0705, open to non-majors if space is available), focused on a range of works on the comprehensive reading list.</p>
<p><strong>(6) </strong>Senior Comprehensive Examination (LITS 0700) in preparation for the written comprehensive examination. Students engaged in such preparation arrange  to meet with one another over the course of winter term, and often solicit faculty participation in discussions of individual texts they have chosen to work on as a group.</p>
<p><strong>(7)</strong> Written Comprehensive Examination (LITS 0700) (on works that appear on the Literary Studies comprehensive reading list), taken at the end of winter term of the senior year. As indicated, this five-hour written examination represents the second part of the comprehensive requirement, the oral specialization examination in LITS 0701 being the first.</p>
<p><strong>(8) </strong>Students achieving an average grade of B+ or higher in the program will be eligible for honors. Honors will be awarded on the basis of the overall grade average in courses in the major, performance on the comprehensive examination, and a senior honors essay of 30-40 pages, to be completed (for one course credit) during the spring semester of the senior year; a one-hour oral examination on the content of this essay is administered by two faculty examiners with expertise in the field of investigation represented.</p>
<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Any literature course in the Middlebury College curriculum (and in approved programs abroad or at other U.S. institutions) may be used to fulfill the requirements in the Program in Literary Studies. Hence, in addition to the specific LITS course descriptions indicated below, students majoring in Literary Studies as well as non-majors with an interest in literature are urged to read through the entire literature offering by various departments (including language departments) to secure a full sense of the range of courses available in any academic year.</p>

			<h3>LITS 0152 Greek Tragedy (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">A survey of selected tragedies by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, exploring the relation between tragedy and political freedom and empire in fifth century B.C. Athens. The course examines the tragic poets' use of traditional Greek myths to question not only the wisdom of contemporary Athenian imperialism but also traditional Greek views on relations between the sexes; between the family and the city; between man's presumed dignity and his belief in gods. Mythical and historical background is supplied through additional readings from Homer and Thucydides. The course asks how the tragedians managed to raise publicly, in the most solemn religious settings, the kind of questions for which Socrates was later put to death. The course culminates in a reading of Aristotle's <em>Poetics</em>. 3 hrs. lect., 1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">Japanese Brazilians are the largest ethnic Japanese community outside Japan. What factors gave rise to this community? How did it expand over time? In this course we will study the modern Japanese diaspora from a Brazilian perspective. The first families from Japan arrived in Brazil in 1908. Why did these families leave their country? Which work did Japanese immigrants do? How did they negotiate their Japanese cultural identities within the Latin American context? To what extent have they contributed to the Brazilian culture? In order to answer these and other questions, students will examine and discuss a set of critical/creative sources that include essay, film, testimony, painting, advertisement, poetry, and literary fiction. In the last segment of the course, we will consider a social-economic counterpoint: the context in which Brazilians of Japanese ethnicity followed the reverse path of their grandparents and massively immigrated to Japan during the 1990s. 3 hrs sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Working across and against disciplines, we will critically engage with Black decolonial worldmaking in these spaces and across periods as we re-evaluate and dismantle this so-called Lusophone world and other imperialist geographies. In the process, we will examine connections between Black life in Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Portugal, and more over the last six centuries; and also how Black life re-historicizes these spaces and times. 3 hrs.sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>PGSE 0351 Brazilian Cinema and Culture (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will analyze how Brazilian cinema has been approaching issues related to Brazilian society and culture since mid-twentieth century to the present. Issues may range from colonialism and neocolonialism, dictatorship and revolutionary movements, and the permanence of violence in the fabric of society, to gender identity and diverse sexualities, or race and racism. Throughout the course we will also learn about different movements, moments, aesthetics, and filmmakers, as well as how filmic genres are constructed in Brazilian cinema. Readings will be taken from film criticism and history, social and historical analysis, as well as from other theoretical frameworks, such as gender theory or critical race theory.

			<h3>SPAN 0367 Understanding Decolonial Thought (Spring 2023)</h3>

Decolonizing requires the exposure of structures of oppression that remain in a society after colonization. We will therefore focus on coloniality of power (e.g. intersection of race and capitalism, biopolitics), coloniality of gender (abortion, the privilege of the phallus, hypersexualization, violence against female and trans bodies), coloniality of knowledge (education, privileging the Global North), coloniality of being (religious imaginaries, existential phenomenology), and visuality vs. countervisuality (what we are allowed to see vs. what is there to be seen). Among authors included: Quijano, Fanon, Mbembe, Lugones, Segato, hooks, Maldonado-Torres, Mierzoff, Coates, Wynter, and Ahmed.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>SPAN 0374 Soccer in Latin America (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Why are Latin Americans so passionate about soccer? The answer to this question is a complex and multifaceted one. The history of this passion goes back to the mid-19th century when British workers were sent to Latin America to build railroads and operate railroad companies. Along with them, soccer arrived in the region. The first documented match took place in Argentina in 1867. Since then, soccer quickly spread out over Latin America to become the most popular sport — by a large margin — in nearly every country. In this course we will examine the history of soccer in Latin America and its links to politics, culture, racial issues, and gender discrimination. We will also take a look at the lives of iconic figures such as Di Stéfano, Garrincha, Pelé, Maradona, Messi, and Marta. The course is intended to finish with a soccer practice and a match against another team. 3hrs.sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">In this class we will study 20th and 21st century adventure narratives from the Americas to explore how artists have struggled to represent Asian or Middle East cultures within or against Western imperialist ideologies. We will use Edward Said’s seminal work Orientalism as a theoretical framework and study how racist narratives are predominant within our industrial mass media (radio, serials, films, comic books, social media, and streaming services). Furthermore, we will explore how new gender and race paradigms have provided space for adventure narratives that attempt to dismantle the biases against Asian citizens in the Americas. This class will cover from Martial Arts narratives in the United States to Mexican Geisha comic books to Argentinean adventures in the Middle East.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>SPAN 0388 Gender and Violence in the Hispanic World (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Differences in the way men and women display violent behavior need to be better understood to prevent acts of murder and massive, often irreversible, harm. In this course we will try to find answers to: What are the origins and explanations of violence in all its forms?  How are gendered identities produced and reproduced in society?  How is gender implicated in violence?  How can the new politics of masculinity inform our discussion of the connection between gender and violence?  Discussion and analysis of a  variety of materials from different disciplines will form the basis of our exploration, which will focus mainly on the representation of violence in Hispanic culture.  Readings will include literary texts by Dolores Redondo, Sergio Álvarez, Élmer Mendoza, and theoretical texts by Suzanne E. Hatt and Elizabeth Wood.

The goal is to give students the analytic tools they need to think deeply about the centrality of porn to our lives and to global capitalism, creating jobs in the “gig economy” as well as huge amounts of profit even as it extracts unpaid labor from trafficked bodies. We will consider pornographic photography, cinema, AI, and deep fakes. Texts will include Linda Williams’ <em>Hard Core: Power, Pleasure, and the ‘Frenzy of the Visible</em>,” Gayle Rubin’s “<em>Thinking Sex</em>,” Heather Berg, <em>Porn Work</em> and Jennifer Nash’s <em>The Black Body in Ecstasy</em>. In the SPAN section of the course, students will also be asked to participate in Spanish at least three times on the Spanish-language day of the class.

From a historical point of view, we will explore literary concepts such as <em>bucolismo</em> and <em>naturalismo</em>, the <em>paleto</em> cinema of the Francoism era and its contestation in <em>Los santos inocentes</em>. From there we will move to contemporary issues such as the vindication of the <em>España vaciada</em>, and new critical approaches such as the glocal, the rurban, and ecofeminism. We will include the voices of Ana Iris Simón, Oliver Laxe and María Sánchez that portray rural spaces and its inhabitants with respect and dignity. The goal of this course is to showcase rural spaces as sophisticated, diverse, and complex while we explore our own experience of Middlebury as a rural place.

With a strong emphasis on the American continent, the course will have a global approach, which will allow us to delve into issues of neoliberalism, cannibalism, genocide, diaspora, virus spread, and political criticism. The main goal is to expose colonial structures embedded in the representation of zombies, as well as in the making of the genre. Among films included are: <em>White Zombie</em>, <em>The Night of the Living Dead</em>, <em>Savageland</em>, <em>World War Z</em> (United States); <em>Mangue negro</em> (Brazil), <em>Juan de los muertos</em> (Cuba), <em>El desierto</em> (Argentina), <em>El año del apocalipsis</em> (Peru); <em>Ladronas de almas</em>, <em>Halley</em> (Mexico); <em>Descendents</em> (Chile), <em>Rec</em> (Spain), <em>I’ll see You in my Dreams</em> (Portugal), <em>The Girl with All the Gifts</em> (United Kingdom); <em>Train to Busan</em> (Korea); <em>The Empire of Corpses</em>, and <em>Versus</em> (Japan).

Credits for MATH 0121 and 0122 may be earned through the College Board AP exams or international exams such as the A-Levels or IB. At the discretion of the chair, additional courses may be waived in recognition of exceptional secondary school preparation. However, in all cases the major must include at least seven (7) Middlebury College or approved transfer courses, and the minor must include at least 4. Students who have earned grades on advanced placement calculus exams that are eligible for credit may not register for the equivalent course at Middlebury College.</p>
<p>Thus students who have earned 4 or 5 on the Calculus AB exam or a 3 on the Calculus BC exam may not register for MATH 0121, students who have earned 4 or 5 on the Calculus BC exam may not register for MATH 0121 or MATH 0122. This policy applies irrespective of whether students choose to use their AP credits toward meeting Middlebury’s graduation requirements. The following international credentials carry the same credit as a 4 or 5 on the Calculus BC Exam: A-level exam with a mathematics grade of A, B, or C; or IB Higher Level Mathematics with a grade of 6 or 7.</p>
<p>See more information on <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/mathematics/resources/placement-information">Placement</a>.</p>
<h2>Other Credits</h2>
<p>Because of the wide variation in course offerings at other institutions, students wishing to substitute a course from another college for any course in mathematics must seek approval from the department before registering for the course.</p>

			<h3>MATH 0106 Math and Board Games (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Have you ever spent minutes agonizing over which move to make in a board game? Out of all the possible options, how could you possibly determine which move is best? Was there even an objectively best decision? In this course, we will explore the mathematics and underlying gameplay structures of several modern board games. In addition to playing these games during class, we’ll use math and logic to assess and quantify the value of a range of possible in-game decisions. Using formal mathematical proofs, papers, and in-class discussions, we’ll analyze the fairness and equity of strategies across a wide variety of games. We’ll finish the course by designing our own board game based on what we’ve learned! (Students who have completed FYSE1216 are not eligible to enroll in MATH 0106.)</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>MATH 0230 Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In roughly 300 BCE, Euclid set down his axioms of geometry which subsequently became the standard by which people understood the mathematics of the world around them.  In the first half of the 19th century, mathematicians realized, however, that they could remove one of Euclid’s axioms, the one known as the “parallel postulate,” and still produce logically consistent examples of geometries.  These new geometries displayed behaviors that were wildly different from Euclidean geometry.  In this course we will study examples of these revolutionary non-Euclidean geometries, with a focus on Klein's Erlangen Program, which is a modern way of understanding them.

We often represent an object with a vertex (node) and a relation between a pair with an edge (line).  With the graph in hand, we then ask questions, such as: Is it connected? Can one traverse each edge precisely once and return to a starting vertex? For a fixed <em>k/, is it possible to “color” the vertices using /k</em> colors so that no two vertices that share an edge receive the same color?  More formally, we study the following topics: trees, distance, degree sequences, matchings, connectivity, coloring, and planarity.  Proof writing is emphasized.

If you are, say, in Mosul or Baghdad, in Damascus or Aleppo, in Gaza or Hebron, in Jerusalem or Kfar Etzion or Tel Aviv, in Amman or Beirut, in Cairo or El Arish, in Doha or Riyadh. Each of those places stimulates a different sense of security, in the personal or collective sense, and yet their overall security discourse is interconnected. The overall discourse on security in the Middle East is influenced, affected, interrupted, and shaped by what is going on in the region. They represent different facets of the larger issue and discourse of security in the Middle East.<br><br>
The seminar will address the issue and the discourse of security in the Middle East, with stress on the two sides of the spectrum, from weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to acts of terrorism. We will look at the issue of security from both the national and the regional levels.<br><br>
The seminar’s fundamental starting point is that to understand the issue of security in the region one must examine the broader historical fundamentals of the region. Religion, ethnicity, ideology, identity and, of course, politics are all closely related to the broader issue of security. Those issues are at the core of all regional conflicts as well as global terrorism; those issues shape the making of the modern Middle East. For this reason the seminar begins with a broad introduction on the making of the modern Middle East. Among the basic themes to be discussed in that introduction are:<br><br>
 the idea of the “Middle East” as a distinct geo-political region;<br>
 the fundamentals of the region: the religious, ethnic, and linguistic composition of the Middle East;<br>
The split Sunni versus Shia<br>
Islam as the major religion of the Middle East;<br>
the collapse of the Ottoman Empire as the cradle of the modern Middle East;<br>
the formation of the state system in the Middle East;<br>
the rise of political Zionism,<br>
the birth of the Arab-Israeli conflict;<br>
the rise of modern Iran;<br>
 the creation of Modern Saudi Arabia and the Gulf;<br><br>
Then, and against this introductory background, the seminar will examine the issue of contemporary security in the Middle East from both national and regional perspectives. We will look at the issue of security in the cases of the major states in the Middle East: Egypt, Iraq, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Israel. As it turns out, those countries –each in its unique way -- struggle now with issues of national identity and ideology that shapes their sense of security or lack therein.<br><br>
The final part of the seminar will deal with regional issues involve regional security, WMD and ISIS. We will review not only the formation of the nuclear order in the Middle East where is Israel maintains a “benign monopoly” but also the history of the efforts to constrain and control the spread of WMD in the region, and why those efforts turned out not to be successful. The seminar will end by discussing the history as well as the desirability and feasibility of the efforts to establish the Middle East as WMD free zone. <strong>The dates of this course are SEPTEMBER 6 through DECEMBER 16</strong>.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

		<article class="requirements"><h2>Required for the Major</h2>
<p>The requirements for the major in molecular biology and biochemistry provide a multidisciplinary yet integrated approach to examining life at the macromolecular, cellular, and organismal levels. The major is composed of 15 required courses including foundation courses, advanced courses, and four electives selected among three thematic suites. Required foundation courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology establish a strong, broad understanding of the science necessary for advanced study. Required advanced courses in the core areas of molecular biology and biochemistry build on this foundation. Finally, elective courses offer advanced opportunities to explore a wide variety of specific topics including neurobiology, developmental biology, computational biology, data science, molecular genetics, and biochemical mechanisms. Students may engage in mentored independent research in these areas.</p>

<p>AP Statistics will not satisfy the statistics requirement. Students with AP Statistics credit will be required to enroll in BIOL 0211 or MATH 0116. AP Calculus, IB or A-level Mathematics exams, bypass exams, or any pre-college course in calculus will not exempt a student from the background math course requirement. Students will need to enroll in a math class that they are placed into by the Math Department. Placement is decided by the Math Department based on either scores on advanced placement exams or review of high school records. </p>
<p>Some graduate schools may require two semesters each of mathematics and physics. Students interested in the health professions can learn more about the <a href="https://sites.middlebury.edu/cci/health-professions/the-big-picture/">pre-health requirements</a> and are encouraged to reach out to the health professions team for individual support.</p>
<h2>Study Abroad and Transfer Credits</h2>
<p>Students who consider taking summer courses or courses abroad must consult with their advisor about the process of transferring credit from another institution. With approval of the Program Director, transferred credits may count towards the major requirements. </p>
<h2>Molecular Biology and Biochemistry Research</h2>
<p>Research is an important component of a well-rounded academic pursuit; it contributes to the development of independence and creativity, as well as to the depth of knowledge needed to become an active contributor to the scientific community. Majors may undertake independent research with a faculty mentor in MBBC or in other Departments and Programs, provided the research falls within the mission of the major. Any major is eligible to perform an independent study research project (BIOL 0500, CHEM 0500, NSCI 0500, or BIOL/CHEM/NSCI/MBBC 0700) with the consent of a mentor.</p>
<h2>Requirements for Honors</h2>
<p>Senior thesis research may be initiated by any junior with the consent of a mentor. Students considering senior thesis research are urged to begin conversations with faculty early in their junior year (certainly by winter term) because many thesis projects begin during the summer preceding the senior year. Those eligible for honors or high honors in molecular biology and biochemistry will: (1) complete at least two semesters of research, which may include winter term; (2) enroll in MBBC 0701 for their final semester of research; (3) graduate with a minimum GPA of 3.3 for all courses counting towards the major; (4) present a public seminar describing the significance, methodology, results, and conclusions of their research; (5) successfully defend their thesis before a committee of three faculty, two of whom must be affiliated with the MBBC program; and (6) earn a grade of at least B+ for MBBC 0701, as determined by the members of the MBBC program, with the grade based on their research performance, their written thesis, their thesis presentation and their thesis defense.</p>

			<h3>MUSC 0239 The Cultural Work of Country Music (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">“I like all kinds of music...except country.”  Arguably, aversion to American country music often tracks with class- and race-based assumptions about both makers and consumers of this genre.  In this course we will challenge those views while studying the history of the form.  Balancing our consideration of the big picture with case studies of performers like Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, and The Chicks, we will explore what types of music the “country” tag comprises; some of the major themes and motifs associated with the form; the Black and White roots of country music; and the politicization of the music and its performers throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.  Source materials for the course will include Bill Malone’s <em>Country Music, USA</em>; Ken Burn’s <em>Country Music</em> documentary; <em>Creating Country Music: Fabricating Authenticity</em>, and <em>A Good-Natured Riot: The Birth of the Grand Ole Opry</em>.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>MUSC 0240 Performing Chamber Music (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course for intermediate to advanced performers we will explore the art of collaborative music making in the classical tradition. Students will form small vocal and instrumental ensembles (2–6 players) at the beginning of the semester or may enroll in the course as an established ensemble. Repertoire will be determined in collaboration with instructor. Weekly coaching sessions for each group and master classes for all groups will culminate in at least one end-of-semester performance and writing assignment. In addition to technical performance issues, master classes and readings will consider group dynamics, rehearsal techniques, and interpersonal aspects of musical collaboration. Although previous chamber music experience is not required, students should be experienced performers of notation-based music. 3 hrs. lect/disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>MUSC 0245 Collaborative Improvisation: All-Arts Ensemble (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course/ensemble we will open dialogues of performance, improvisation, and social interaction across disciplines in the arts. How do the various disciplines relate to each other in a performance environment? It may be easy to see points of commonality between music and dance or writing and theater, but what about the act of painting and the process of musical improvisation? Through the work of Ornette Coleman, Del Close, John Cage, Pauline Oliveros, and others, students will explore improvisation in music, theater, dance, and visual art. The class will culminate in a performance. All students are welcome. 3 hrs. lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

<h2>Senior Work</h2>
<p>A senior seminar in a neuroscience area, approved by the program. Offerings vary year by year, but possible courses include: </p>
<ul><li>BIOL/NSCI 0420 Neurogenetics</li>
<li>BIOL 0475 Neuroplasticity</li>
<li>BIOL/NSCI 0480 Neurobiology</li>
<li>NSCI 0410 Neural Coding</li>

<li>PSYC/NSCI 0437 Social/Emotional Brain or a NSCI relevant BIOL, PSYC or PHIL 0400 level course approved in advance by the NSCI Program) <strong>OR</strong> senior research (NSCI 0500, NSCI 0700 and NSCI 0701)</li>
</ul><p>If a student completes their senior work by taking NSCI 0500/0700/0701, they may use one (and only one) senior seminar as an elective towards the major. In that case the seminar will be counted as an elective only after NSCI 0500/0700/0701 is completed.   However, if a student fulfills their senior work requirement using a senior seminar, they may not count an additional senior seminar as an elective, unless approved by the instructor in consultation with the program director</p>
<p>During winter term and as course offerings change there may be others that are available for NSCI seminar credit.  Seniors can do research with any faculty in the program, or with certain faculty in other departments provided the research project is approved by the neuroscience faculty and the project is related to understanding the nervous system and the mind.</p>
<h2>Independent Research and Program Honors</h2>
<p>Majors are encouraged to undertake independent research (NSCI 0500, NSCI 0700, NSCI 0701) with any faculty member in the program. Students considering any senior research should begin conversations with faculty early in their junior year. Those eligible for honors in neuroscience must (1) complete at least two semesters of thesis-related research (one term of NSCI 0500 or NSCI 0700 and one term of NSCI 0701); (2) have a minimum GPA of 3.3 in major courses (excluding NSCI 0500/0700/0701); (3) present a public seminar describing the background, methodology, results, and greater significance of their research; (4) submit a written thesis and (5) successfully defend their thesis before a committee composed of at least two Neuroscience faculty members, plus others as needed who may recommend High Honors after considering these five components of a thesis.</p>
<h2>Study Abroad</h2>
<p>Study abroad can be a valuable experience that is encouraged, though majors must consult with the Office of Off-Campus Study and their advisor about the advisability of specific programs. Because the requirements for the NSCI major are complex, we recommend that students study abroad for a single term rather than an entire year. It is expected that, with the exception of courses satisfying the Fundamentals of Philosophical Neuroscience requirement, the required courses listed for the major specifically by number (i.e. PSYC 0105, BIOL 0145, PSYC 0201 or BIOL 0211, NSCI 0251, NSCI 0252) would be completed at Middlebury. Students may satisfy the Fundamentals of Philosophical Neuroscience requirement by means of an equivalent course taken abroad, but should seek approval for this course before going abroad.  NSCI electives may be taken abroad if they are determined to satisfy program requirements and are approved by the advisor and program director. Students generally receive major credit for a maximum of two courses taken abroad. The NSCI program does not grant major credit for Independent Study projects completed abroad.</p>
<h2>Advanced Placement</h2>
<p><strong><em>Psychology Department placement exam:</em></strong><em><strong> </strong></em><em>Students who receive a passing score on the Psychology Department placement exam<strong> </strong>may bypass PSYC 0105, however they will need to take an additional </em>elective to fulfill their Neuroscience Requirements. (More details can be found on the Psychology Requirements page.)</p>
<p><em><strong>Statistics AP Exam:</strong></em><strong> </strong>Students matriculating<em> Fall 2016 or later</em> may not use the Statistics AP Examination in place of taking PSYC 0201 (Psychological Statistics) or BIOL 0211 (Biostats). Credit for PSYC 0201 is given to students matriculating<em> <strong>prior to Fall 2016</strong></em> who achieve a score of 4 or 5 on the <strong>Statistics AP Examination</strong>. These students do not need to take an additional course for the major.  </p>
<p><em><strong>Chemistry AP and Placement Exam</strong></em><em><strong>: </strong></em>Students with a score <strong>of 4 or 5 on the Chemistry AP Exam, </strong>or who pass the <strong>Chemistry Department Placement Exam, </strong>may bypass CHEM 0103 and do not need an additional course for the major.</p>

		<h1>Department of Philosophy</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>Required for the Major</h2>
<p>Majors must complete no fewer than eleven courses in the department, to include:</p>
<ol><li>Logic Requirement: PHIL 0180 (to be taken by the end of the sophomore year)</li>
<li>History Requirement: any two courses in the history of philosophy at the 0200 or 0300 level.</li>
<li>Distribution Requirement:
<ul><li>One course in Ethics and Social &amp; Political Philosophy (ESP); and</li>
<li>One course in Epistemology, Language, Metaphysics, Mind and Science (ELMMS).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Upper-level Course Requirement:  Three courses at the 0300 or 0400 level, at least one of which must be a 0400-level course. (Students may count only one cross-listed 300-level course taught by faculty outside the Philosophy Department towards their upper-level course requirement. 0400-level courses will not normally satisfy the distribution requirement. Courses taken while abroad will not generally be allowed to substitute for the required 0400-level course.)</li>
<li>Senior Independent Research Requirement</li>
<li>At least two other philosophy courses, in order to fulfill the eleven-course requirement. </li>
</ol><p>Cognate courses may be substituted for no more than two departmental electives, but will not satisfy the departmental distribution requirement; such substitutions require the prior approval of a major’s departmental adviser, and must be at the 0200-level or above.</p>
<h3>Senior Independent Research Requirement</h3>
<p>Majors must complete a one-semester independent research project (PHIL 0710) in the fall of their senior year. Topics and advisers will be decided through consultation with members of the department. PHIL 0710 includes participation in the senior project workshop held for all students completing their independent work.</p>
<h3>Departmental Honors</h3>
<p>Students will be awarded departmental honors if and only if they receive a) at least an A- average in courses counted toward the major, and b) an A- on their senior project.  Students will be awarded high honors if and only if they receive a) at least an A- average in courses counted toward the major, and b) an A on their senior project. </p>
<h2>Required for the Joint Major</h2>
<p>For the philosophy component of a joint major, students must take nine philosophy courses, including</p>
<ol><li>PHIL 0180, to be taken by the end of the sophomore year;</li>
<li>One 0400-level seminar to be taken in the last three semesters;</li>
<li>A course in each of the following:
<ul><li>One course in the History of Philosophy (HIST)</li>
<li>One course in Ethics and Social &amp; Political Philosophy (ESP) and</li>
<li>One course in Epistemology, Language, Metaphysics, Mind and Science (ELMMS)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A course in which the student completes a senior independent project that shows evidence of having integrated the training of both major fields.  (Normally this course will be PHIL 0710, though other models may be appropriate.)  The topic and scope of the independent project is to be determined in consultation with both major advisers. </li>
<li>At least three other philosophy courses, in order to fulfill the nine-course requirement.</li>
</ol><h2>Required for the Minor</h2>
<p>A total of six courses in philosophy, including PHIL 0180 and at least one course at the 0300 or 0400 level. Minors wishing to take a 0400-level seminar must have completed three other philosophy courses first. Enrollment priority in 0400-level seminars will be given to majors. Students electing the philosophy minor are encouraged to consult with faculty members in the Philosophy Department about course planning.</p>

			<h3>PHIL 0156 Contemporary Moral Issues (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">We will examine a selection of pressing moral problems of our day, seeking to understand the substance of the issues and learning how moral arguments work. We will focus on developing our analytical skills, which we can then use to present and criticize arguments on difficult moral issues. Selected topics may include world poverty, animal rights, abortion, euthanasia, human rights, just and unjust wars, capital punishment, and racial and gender issues. You will be encouraged to question your own beliefs on these issues, and in the process to explore the limit and extent to which ethical theory can play a role in everyday ethical decision making. 2 hrs.lect./1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>PHIL 0180 Introduction to Modern Logic (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Logic is concerned with good reasoning; as such, it stands at the core of the liberal arts. In this course we will develop our reasoning skills by identifying and analyzing arguments found in philosophical, legal, and other texts, and also by formulating our own arguments. We will use the formal techniques of modern propositional and predicate logic to codify and test various reasoning strategies and specific arguments. No prior knowledge of logic, formal mathematics, or computer science is presupposed in this course, which does not count towards the PHL distribution requirement but instead towards the deductive reasoning requirement. 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">This class introduces students to the range and power of Greek thought, which initiated the Western philosophical tradition. We will begin by exploring the origins of philosophy as found in myth (primarily Hesiod) and in the highly original speculation of the Pre-Socratic thinkers (such as Heraclitus and Parmenides). We will then focus on Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, examining their transformations of these earlier traditions and their own divergent approaches to ethics and education. We will also consider the influences of Greek philosophy on later thought. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>PHIL 0214 Science and Society (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Science is not developed in a vacuum. Social circumstances influence the practice of science and in turn, science shapes how we organize ourselves as a society. We will investigate both directions of this relationship, asking such questions as: how do the values of society drive scientific research? What does it mean for science to be understood as objective? And how can socially and politically influenced scientific work be trusted? Drawing on the work of philosophers of science and interdisciplinary science studies scholars we will investigate what makes science such a powerful method of understanding the world, and how social and political pressures play a role in shaping and applying that understanding. We will also investigate the challenges of developing public trust in science by focusing on examples of socially significant scientific research such as climate science and research related to the Covid pandemic. 3 hrs. lect. <strong>This course is part of the Public Humanities Labs Initiative administered by the Axinn Center for the Humanities.*</strong></span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">Moral psychology is the study of human behavior in the context of morality. How do we think about morality? How do we make moral judgments? How do we behave in moral situations? Answering these questions forces us to think deeply about the nature of our actions and the way we do and should evaluate them. In this course we will explore these questions and more. Specific topics covered may include  altruism and egoism, moral judgment, moral responsibility, practical deliberation, intentional action, virtue and vice, character, and moral development. Readings will be drawn from both philosophy and psychology. (not open to students who have taken PHIL 0310) 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

This course will explore several of the major recent philosophical conceptions of the mind. A central focus will be on evaluating various attempts to explain the mind in purely physical terms, including the project of artificial intelligence (AI). Can these theories give us a complete understanding of the mind? Other key questions will include: What is the nature of thought, and how is it capable of representing the world? What is consciousness, and can it be explained physically? 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">Perhaps no individual has left his mark more completely and enduringly upon an entire civilization than Confucius (551-479 B.C.) has upon that of China. Moreover, the influence of Confucius has spread well beyond China to become entrenched in the cultural traditions of neighboring Japan and Korea and elsewhere. This course examines who Confucius was, what he originally intended, and how the more important of his disciples have continued to reinterpret his original vision and direct it toward different ends.

			<h3>PHIL 0319 Readings in the Philosophy of History (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Even before the appearance of Georg W. F. Hegel's classic study The Philosophy of History, a heated debate was being waged concerning the nature and substance of history. Is history, like science, expressible in predictable patterns or subject to irrevocable laws? What factors distinguish true history from the mere random succession of events? What should we assume to be the fundamental nature of historical truth, and are we to determine it objectively or subjectively? Is it possible to be human and yet be somehow "outside of" history? These are among the questions we will examine as we read and deliberate on a variety of philosophies of history, while concentrating on the most influential versions developed by Hegel and Karl Marx. 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>PHIL 0354 Philosophy of Language (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Speaking a language is a complex form of behavior that plays a rich and varied role in human life. The philosophy of language seeks to give a philosophical account of this phenomenon, focusing on such questions as: How does language gain meaning?  How does meaning relate to truth and reference?  What is conveyed by different speech acts?  In the Public Humanities Lab component of the course, students will apply their understanding of these themes to case studies involving issues such as free speech, linguistic oppression and silencing, the meaning of terms for gender and race, and truth in political speech.  Readings will include works by Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, and contemporary journal articles.  (Previous course in philosophy or waiver.)  3 hrs lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>PHIL 0360 Consciousness (Fall 2022, Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will focus on recent philosophical issues in the study of consciousness:  What is the nature of our conscious subjective experience?  What is the function of conscious states?  Can we find neural correlates of consciousness, and if so, can consciousness simply be reduced to them?  If not, how does consciousness relate to the physical?  Is there something irreducible about the qualitative features of consciousness (qualia)?  Could computers ever be conscious?  Are animals conscious?  We will consider such questions through the writings of contemporary philosophers and neuroscientists such as Dennett, Chalmers, Churchland, Nagel, Damasio, and Searle.

constrain the actions of states and how these principles support a conception of global justice. Also, we will seek to understand what global<br>
responsibilities are entailed by global justice. Specific topics that will be considered include global distributive justice, world poverty, human<br>
rights, humanitarian intervention, and the relationship between global justice and nationalistic moral concerns. Authors will include Beitz,<br>

But what are they, and how do they relate to reality?  In this course we will examine prominent contemporary philosophical theories of concepts, drawing as well on readings from cognitive science and neuroscience.  Possible topics include:  Is it possible to define concepts?  How are they mentally represented?  Is reality relative to conceptual schemes?  Do concepts give us knowledge of reality or hinder our awareness of it?  Is perception nonconceptual?  Do animals have concepts?

		<h1>Physical Education</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><p>The physical education program concentrates on lifetime sports and activities, so that all students leave Middlebury College with exposure to sports or recreational activities in which they have developed a degree of skill and interest, which will be an asset to them in later years. Each course carries one unit of physical education credit.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Before graduation, students must complete two courses to receive the required two credits. Students are encouraged to complete the credits by the end of their fourth academic semester at Middlebury (excluding winter term). In the case of transfer students, students are encouraged to complete the requirement by the end of their second semester at Middlebury. Students who have not completed their requirements will not be eligible to graduate.</p>
<h2>Team Participation</h2>
<p>Students may use participation on varsity intercollegiate teams as a way of satisfying the physical education requirement. The requirement will be fulfilled if a student participates in two seasons of varsity competition. Two-sport athletes may also satisfy both physical education credits through participation on two different varsity intercollegiate teams. </p>
<p>The Physical Education Department also recognizes participation in five club sports. The five club sports that can receive a physical education credit are rugby, crew, water polo, sailing and equestrian, which have a coach on-site for practices and games. In order to receive a physical education credit, students must participate in one full season of crew, rugby, water polo, sailing or equestrian. Each of these club sports will equal one physical education credit per season.</p>
<h2>Additional Courses</h2>
<p>Students who wish to elect additional courses beyond those required for graduation may register with the department for the appropriate season and be scheduled for classes on a space-available basis. Some of the courses and activities follow:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Certification Courses</strong> (textbook and related fee applicable): Lifeguard Training, and First Aid/CPR.</li>
<li><strong>Fee Classes:</strong> alpine skiing, martial arts, massage, meditation, horseback riding, Nordic skiing, spinning, and yoga. Instructors outside of the College generally teach these courses. The fees and times are available during Banner web registration.</li>
<li><strong>Equipment Sports</strong> (students provide equipment): tennis.</li>
<li><strong>More Equipment Sports</strong> (department provides equipment): archery, badminton, golf, and squash.</li>
<li><strong>Conditioning Courses:</strong> Resistance training, strength training, and swim for conditioning. </li>
<li><strong>Dance Courses</strong> (as available): varying levels of ballet, jazz, and modern dance (DANC 0160, DANC 0161, DANC 0162, DANC 0260, DANC 0261, DANC 0276, DANC 0360, DANC 0361, DANC 0380, DANC 0381).</li>
</ul><p>Students may also earn PE credits through programs offered by Student Activities and The Knoll. Approximately 75 courses are scheduled over five sessions each academic year.</p>
<p>The department schedules two seasons of instructional courses in the fall and spring terms and one season in the winter term. Registration is on a first-come, first-served basis and is open to students electing courses on a space-available basis. Students unaware of their physical education record should check with the Registrar’s Office to ensure completion of their program prior to graduation. Applications for transfer credit must be made in advance, following college procedure for academic credit transfer. The Registrar’s Office processes credits from transcripts for students transferring to Middlebury.</p>
<h2>Medical Waivers</h2>
<p>All requests for medical waivers must come from the student’s physician. Injuries and illnesses suffered on campus will be considered as exceptions to the previous statement and will be handled by the College health center.</p>

		<h1>Department of Physics</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><p>The physics program at Middlebury is designed to integrate physics into the liberal arts curriculum, as well as to provide challenging courses and research opportunities for students majoring in physics. Courses and student research activities in astronomy are also part of the physics program. The Physics Department does not offer a minor.</p>
<p>Courses designed especially for nonscience students include PHYS 0155 (Introduction to the Universe), PHYS 0106 (Physics for Educated Citizens), selected offerings in winter term, and first year seminars. Students majoring in the sciences for premedical, pre-engineering, and other professional programs, and others who desire a more analytical approach to physics, usually select courses from the introductory physics sequence PHYS 0109, PHYS 0111, and PHYS 0110. In addition, they may elect more advanced courses at the 0200-level or above.</p>
<p>For those majoring in physics, we offer a broad range of courses that emphasize a variety of topics in physics while building both theoretical understanding and experimental skills. Middlebury physics majors apply their education in a wide variety of careers. Some pursue graduate work in physics and related fields; others find their physics degrees valuable in engineering, medicine, business, law, teaching, government service, and other pursuits. The physics program is designed to serve the needs of both those intending advanced study in physics and those for whom formal work in physics will end with the Middlebury degree.</p>
<p>The physics department encourages its majors to study abroad to gain experience at international research facilities, improve language proficiency, and pursue academic interests outside of physics. Students who study abroad, or in a 2-1-1-1 pre-engineering program, may be eligible to transfer one upper-level physics course per term off campus for the physics major. Transfer is contingent upon approval of the department chair, for a maximum of two transferred courses, of which only one may be an elective. Students should obtain this approval before studying off campus.</p>
<p>Physics majors interested in obtaining high school physics teaching certification should consult the education studies program as soon as possible, preferably no later than the middle of their sophomore year.</p>
<h2>Required for the Major</h2>
<p>The major program consists of the following:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Eight required physics courses: </strong>PHYS 0109, PHYS 0110, PHYS 0111, PHYS 0201, PHYS 0202, PHYS 0212, PHYS 0301, and PHYS 0321</li>
<li>A minimum of <strong>three PHYS electives</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>one-term senior project</strong> (PHYS 0704)</li>
</ul><p>To be eligible for departmental honors, a student must also complete either a semester of senior thesis (PHYS 0705) or one additional elective beyond those required. Mathematics at least through the level of MATH 0122 is also required; this requirement may be satisfied either at Middlebury or through appropriate pre-college courses in calculus.</p>
<p>Electives must be chosen from physics courses at the 0200, 0300, or 0400 level, except that an upper-level physics course taken off campus or an advanced cognate course from another department at Middlebury (specifically, CHEM 0351 or CHEM 0355) may be used to satisfy one of the elective requirements. (For students who entered Middlebury in 2017-18 or 2018-19, CSCI 0202 and MATH 0335 also count as advanced cognate courses.) For students completing double majors, courses counted towards another major cannot also be counted as electives toward the physics major. Independent study courses such as PHYS 0500 may not be used for elective credit. In addition to recurring courses in spring and fall terms, PHYS courses that satisfy the elective requirement are occasionally offered during the winter term.</p>
<p>Prospective majors must begin the physics sequence no later than the sophomore year (typically no later than the third fall/spring term on campus). Starting in the first year allows more flexibility in the choice of courses and senior work and increases the feasibility of off-campus study. Students majoring in physics are advised to complete MATH 0122 (or equivalent) by the end of their first two regular terms. Students planning graduate work in physics or a related subject should elect as many as possible of PHYS 0302 (Electromagnetic Waves), PHYS 0330 (Analytical Mechanics), PHYS 0350 (Statistical Mechanics), and PHYS 0401 (Quantum Mechanics). In addition, MATH 0200 (Linear Algebra), MATH 0223 (Multivariable Calculus), and MATH 0225 (Topics in Linear Algebra and Differential Equations) are strongly recommended for those anticipating graduate study. Most physics majors will find computer programming skills through the level of CSCI 0201 extremely valuable.</p>
<h2>Senior Program</h2>
<p>The senior project (PHYS 0704) involves a significant piece of experimental or theoretical research to be completed in the final year at Middlebury. Topics in recent years have included work in the following areas:</p>
<ul><li>Astrophysics</li>
<li>Atomic and optical physics</li>
<li>Biophysics</li>
<li>Condensed matter physics</li>
<li>Cosmology</li>
<li>Environmental applications</li>
<li>Laser spectroscopy</li>
<li>Classical and quantum waves</li>
<li>Quantum computing</li>
</ul><p>Outstanding performance in PHYS 0704 may, with the permission of the advisor and department, allow continuation of the senior project as a senior thesis (PHYS 0705).</p>
<h2>Departmental Honors</h2>
<p>A minimum grade average of B in physics courses is required of all honors candidates.</p>
<p>To be eligible for departmental honors, a student must also complete either a semester of senior thesis (PHYS 0705) or one additional elective beyond the number required. Honors in physics are awarded primarily on the basis of excellent senior work combined with depth and excellence of coursework in physics. A student’s overall accomplishments in the department, including teaching assistantships and leadership, are also considered in the awarding of honors.</p>
<h2>Pre-Engineering</h2>
<p>Some students study physics with the intent of eventually doing engineering, either through a dual degree or in graduate school.</p>
<p><strong>Students who pursue a physics major en route to a 3-2 engineering degree</strong> (in which the Middlebury component is completed by the end of the junior year) take the same eight-course sequence outlined above, with one elective chosen from physics courses at the 0200, 0300, or 0400 level; they also must complete a one-unit senior project (PHYS 0704).</p>
<p><strong>Students in a 2-1-1-1 pre-engineering program</strong> (those who return to Middlebury for the senior year) take the normal physics major and choose electives in consultation with the pre-engineering advisor. One upper-level physics course per term completed off campus may be counted towards the major with the approval of the department chair, for a maximum of two transferred physics courses, only one of which may be an elective.</p>
<h2>Advanced Placement</h2>
<p>Students who seek advanced placement in physics should take the College Board AP examinations. Credit for PHYS 0109 is given to students who achieve a score of 4 or 5 on the Physics C: Mechanics examination.</p>

			<h3>PHYS 0155 An Introduction to the Universe (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Our universe comprises billions of galaxies in a rapidly expanding fabric. How did it begin? Will it expand forever, or how may it end? How do the stars that compose the galaxies evolve from their births in clouds of gas, through the tranquility of middle age, to their often violent deaths? How can scientists even hope to answer such cosmic questions from our vantage point on a small planet, orbiting a very ordinary star? Are there other planets, orbiting other stars, where intelligent beings may be pondering similar issues? This introductory astronomy course, designed for nonscience majors, will explore these and other questions. Students will also become familiar with the night sky, both as part of our natural environment and as a scientific resource, through independent observations and sessions at the College Observatory. The approach requires no college-level mathematics, but students should expect to do quantitative calculations using scientific notation and occasionally to use elementary high-school algebra. 3 hrs. lect./1 hrs.disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

		<h1>Department of Political Science</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><p><em>Students who matriculate in Fall 2020 or later will adhere to the following requirements.</em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>Students who matriculated prior to Fall 2020 may choose either the following requirements or the <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/political-science/requirements#previous-requirements">previous requirements</a>, below.</em></p>
<h2>Required for the Major in Political Science</h2>
<p>All regular fall and spring term political science courses fall into one of five categories: (1) American Politics, (2) Comparative Politics, (3) International Relations and Foreign Policy, (4) Methods, and (5) Political Theory. A major must take ten regular political science courses, including:</p>
<p>     (1)  At least one American Politics course<br>
     (2)  At least one Comparative Politics course<br>
     (3)  At least one International Relations and Foreign Policy course<br>
     (4)  At least one Methods course<br>
     (5)  At least one Political Theory course</p>
<p>Each of the five categories must be fulfilled by a course taken at Middlebury College in Vermont. We recommend that students start with 100-level courses, whenever possible. No more than one of the ten PSCI major credits may be obtained through a winter term course, and the course is eligible to fulfill a category requirement if it has a PSCI designation. At least seven of the ten courses must be taken at Middlebury College in Vermont.</p>
<h2>Senior Program</h2>
<p>One of the ten required courses must be a PSCI or PSCI cross-listed 0400-level senior seminar offered by a member of the Middlebury faculty in Vermont. Work done in programs abroad, at other North American colleges and universities, or in the Washington Semester program will not count as the equivalent of a Middlebury seminar. IGST seminars co-taught by PSCI faculty cannot substitute for 0400-level PSCI seminars but will count as an elective towards the 10 required courses in PSCI.</p>
<h2>Departmental Honors</h2>
<p>Students who elect to seek departmental honors write a thesis in their senior year. Honors candidates should initiate the process by contacting their prospective faculty advisor during their junior year (including students who are abroad during their junior year). Candidates must submit an honors thesis proposal to their advisor prior to the term(s) in which the thesis is to be written. If the proposal is approved, the student may register for PSCI 0500 (independent project) in the first term of the thesis, followed by PSCI 0700 for the second and third terms. All students who plan to write a thesis are strongly encouraged to enroll in a Methods course before their senior year. After an oral examination of the completed thesis, honors are conferred or denied on the basis of (1) the level of the grade achieved on the thesis; and (2) the level of the average grade received in other fall and spring courses taken at Middlebury. Courses taken abroad do not count toward the grade point determination. Honors theses candidates will have a political science course average of at least 3.33 and a thesis grade of B+ or higher to attain honors; a political science course average of at least 3.50 and a thesis grade of A- or higher to attain high honors; and a political science course average of at least 3.67 and a thesis grade of A to attain highest honors. For a full description of regulations, check the Thesis Procedures and Schedule page on the PSCI website.</p>
<h2>Independent Study</h2>
<p>Students with demonstrated preparation and proficiency in the field may elect independent study projects (PSCI 0500). These projects are prepared under the supervision of a member or members of the department. The PSCI 0500 projects may not be substituted for the seminar requirement. The PSCI 0500 projects are reading and research courses; the department will not award PSCI 0500 credit for political experience such as congressional internships. No more than one of the ten courses required for the major may be a PSCI 0500 credit.</p>
<h2>Joint Majors</h2>
<p>Students wishing to do a joint major in political science and another department or program of studies must take eight regular political science courses. Among the eight total courses required for the major, the student must take at least one course in each of the five categories, including a 0400-level seminar. Students must also give evidence of having used the training in both majors, usually in a seminar paper, but sometimes in an independent project or thesis. At least five courses including the 0400-level seminar must be taken at Middlebury College in Vermont. Students may count a maximum of one political science winter term course toward the eight required courses for the joint major. Joint majors do not qualify for honors in political science. (Double majors are eligible.)</p>
<h3>International Politics and Economics Major</h3>
<p>The IP&amp;E major allows students to combine the study of politics, economics, and languages, linking these disciplines with an appropriate experience abroad. Students wishing to pursue this major should refer to International Politics and Economics in both the General Catalog and the online catalog.</p>
<h3>International and Global Studies Major</h3>
<p>IGST seminars co-taught by PSCI faculty cannot substitute for 0400-level PSCI seminars unless they are cross-listed IGST/PSCI seminars. It is highly recommended that IGST thesis candidates supervised by a PSCI faculty member enroll in a PSCI Methods course before their senior year.</p>
<h2>Minors in Political Science</h2>
<p>The minor in political science will consist of five courses taken at Middlebury College, which must come from at least three of the five categories of courses offered by the department, and may include a maximum of one winter term course. At least one of the courses must be at the 0300-level or above.</p>
<h2>Advanced Placement</h2>
<p>Students may not apply credits earned prior to matriculation toward the ten courses required for the PSCI major.</p>
<h2>Previous Requirements</h2>
<p><em>Optional only for students who matriculated prior to Fall 2020.</em></p>
<h3>Required for the Major in Political Science</h3>
<p>A major must take ten regular political science courses. One of these ten must be an introductory course in the political theory subfield (PSCI 0101 or PSCI 0107). Two additional courses must be introductory courses in two of the three other subfields: American politics (PSCI 0102 or PSCI 0104); comparative politics (PSCI 0103); and international relations (PSCI 0109). These three required introductory courses should normally be completed before the end of the sophomore year. Among the ten total courses required for the major, the student must also fulfill the field distribution requirement, and complete the 0400-level seminar. At least seven of these ten courses, including the 0400-level seminar, must be taken at Middlebury College in Vermont. Students may count a maximum of one political science winter term course as one of the ten required courses for the major. Winter term courses may be used to fulfill the field distribution requirement.</p>
<h3>The Field Distribution Requirement</h3>
<p>All regular fall and spring term political science courses are classified in one of the following four fields: Political Theory, American Politics, Comparative Politics, and International Relations and Foreign Policy. Students must take at least two courses in any three of these fields and one course in the fourth field<strong>.</strong></p>
<h3>Senior Program</h3>
<p>The senior program consists of a seminar of the major’s choice. Each seminar includes advanced work appropriate to the field in which the seminar is offered. The seminars are the 0400-level courses offered by the department. Seminars are open to juniors and seniors. Normally, the senior program requirement must be completed by taking a seminar offered by a member of the Middlebury faculty. Work done in programs abroad, at other North American colleges and universities, or in the Washington Semester program will not count as the equivalent of a Middlebury seminar. IGST seminars co-taught by PSCI faculty cannot substitute for 0400-level PSCI seminars but will count as an elective towards the 10 required courses in PSCI.</p>
<h3>Departmental Honors</h3>
<p>Students who elect to seek departmental honors write a thesis in the senior year. All students who plan to write a thesis are strongly encouraged to enroll in PSCI 0368 before their senior year (and students writing a political theory thesis are encouraged to take a 0300-level theory course). Honors candidates should initiate the process by contacting their prospective faculty advisor during their junior year (including students who are abroad during their junior year). Candidates must submit an honors thesis proposal to their advisor prior to the term(s) in which the thesis is to be written. If the proposal is approved, the student may register for PSCI 0500 (independent project) in the first term of the thesis, followed by PSCI 0700 for the second and third terms. After an oral examination of the completed thesis, honors are conferred or denied on the basis of (1) the level of the grade achieved on the thesis; and (2) the level of the average grade received in other fall and spring courses taken at Middlebury. Courses taken abroad do not count toward the grade point determination. Honors theses candidates will have a political science course average of at least 3.33 and a thesis grade of B+ or higher to attain honors; a political science course average of at least 3.50 and a thesis grade of A- or higher to attain high honors; and a political science course average of at least 3.67 and a thesis grade of A to attain highest honors. </p>
<h3>Independent Study</h3>
<p>Students with demonstrated preparation and proficiency in the field may elect independent study projects (PSCI 0500). These projects are prepared under the supervision of a member or members of the department. The PSCI 0500 projects may not be substituted for the seminar requirement. The PSCI 0500 projects are reading and research courses; the department will not award PSCI 0500 credit for political experience such as congressional internships.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>Students wishing to do a joint major in political science and another department or program of studies must take eight regular political science courses. One of these eight must be an introductory course in the political theory subfield (PSCI 0101 or PSCI 0107). Two additional courses must be introductory courses in two of the three other subfields: American politics (PSCI 0102 or PSCI 0104); comparative politics (PSCI 0103); and international relations (PSCI 0109). These three required introductory courses should normally be completed before the end of the sophomore year. Among the eight total courses required for the major, the student must also take at least two courses in any two of the four fields of political science and one course in the third and fourth fields and complete a 0400-level seminar. Students must also give evidence of having used the training in both majors, usually in a seminar paper, but sometimes in an independent project or thesis. At least five courses including the 0400-level seminar must be taken at Middlebury College in Vermont. Students may count a maximum of one political science winter term course as one of the eight required courses for the joint major. Winter term courses may be used to fulfill the field distribution requirement. Joint majors do not qualify for honors in political science. (Double majors are eligible.)</p>
<p><strong><em>International Politics and Economics Major</em></strong><em>:</em> The IP&amp;E major allows students to combine the study of politics, economics, and languages, linking these disciplines with an appropriate experience abroad. Students wishing to pursue this major should refer to International Politics and Economics in both the General Catalog and the on-line catalog.</p>
<p><strong><em>International and Global Studies Major</em></strong><em>: </em>IGS seminars co-taught by PSCI faculty cannot substitute for 0400-level PSCI seminars, In addition, it is highly recommended that IGS thesis candidates enroll in PSCI 0368 before their senior year.</p>
<h3>Minors in Political Science</h3>
<p>The minor in political science will consist of five courses taken at Middlebury College, which must come from at least two of the four fields in the department, and may include a maximum of one winter term course. At least one of the courses must be at the 0300-level or above. The five course requirement will not be reduced by AP credits.</p>
<h3>Advanced Placement</h3>
<p>A score of 4 or 5 on the College Board Advanced Placement Examination in American politics will entitle the student to exemption from PSCI 0104; such a score may satisfy the requirement of one course in the American politics field. A score of 4 to 5 on the College Board Advanced Placement Examination in comparative politics will entitle the student to exemption from PSCI 0103; such a score may satisfy the requirement of one course in the comparative politics field. While supplying two college credits, advanced placement in both American politics and comparative politics will only count as one of the ten courses required for the political science major. Students will also receive only one distribution credit for AP courses, and notwithstanding the distribution credit, all students must take at least one course in each subfield.</p>

			<span class="course_description">This course introduces the institutions and practices of American government and politics. The aim is to give students a firm understanding of the workings of and the balance of power among the American Congress, President, bureaucracy, and court system. We begin with the Constitution, which provides the set of founding principles upon which the American government is based. We then look at how American citizens make decisions about politics. Finally, we examine how political institutions, interest groups, parties, elections, and legislative bodies and rules aggregate diverse, often conflicting preferences and how they resolve or exacerbate problems. 3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(American Politics)/</em></span>			<span class="course_requirements">

In this course we will tackle these questions and discuss an array of factors that contribute to global democratic recession including the role of the political elite, failing institutions, eroding norms, and the role of ordinary people. In so doing we will delve deeper into economic and social causes of this decline. Our focus will span from global trends to individual cases such as Venezuela, Turkey, Hungary, India, the United States, and the Philippines. (Not open to students who have taken FYSE 1544) 3 hrs.

		<h1>Department of Psychology</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><p>In keeping with this philosophy, the department offers a broad range of courses that provides students with the opportunity to learn about basic research and its applications in a variety of areas, including social, cognitive, behavioral, cultural, clinical, environmental, educational, biological, and developmental psychology.</p>
<h2>Requirements for the Major in Psychology</h2>
<p>The psychology major consists of a minimum of 10 courses in five categories: (I) Foundation courses, (II) Core courses, (III) Labs, (IV) Advanced seminars, and (V) Electives.<em><strong>      </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>I. Foundation courses</strong></em><strong>:</strong> The foundation courses provide students an overview of the field, the background, and the skills necessary to understand psychology as an empirical science. The required foundation courses are Introduction to Psychology (PSYC 0105) and the Statistics/Research Methods sequence (PSYC 0201 and PSYC 0202). Most students complete the Statistics/Research Methods sequence by the end of their sophomore year, but no later than the end of their junior year.</p>
<p><em><strong>II. Core courses</strong></em><strong>:</strong> All students must complete at least three core courses, one each from three of the five areas below.  Core courses ensure that students have a broad understanding of various subfields within the discipline. Students are strongly encouraged to complete core courses no later than the end of their junior year.</p>
<p><strong>We offer core courses in the following areas:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong><em>Clinical</em></strong><strong>:  </strong><strong>Psychological Disorders (PSYC 0224)</strong></li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Cognitive</em></strong><strong>: Cognitive Psychology (PSYC 0227—<em>formerly PSYC  0305</em>) or Emotions (PSYC 0205)</strong></p>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Developmental</em></strong><strong>: Adolescence (PSYC 0216) or Child Development (PSYC 0225)</strong></li>
</ul><ul><li><strong><em>Physiological</em></strong><strong>: Brain and Behavior (PSYC 0226—<em>formerly PSYC 0301</em>)</strong></li>
</ul><ul><li><strong><em>Social/Personality</em></strong><strong>:  Social Psychology (PSYC 0203) or Personality Psychology (PSYC 0204) or Cultural Psychology (PSYC 0220)</strong></li>
</ul><p><em><strong>III. Labs: </strong></em>All students must take at least one course with a lab section in addition to Psychological Statistics and Research Methods in Psychology. The lab course may also fulfill another course requirement simultaneously (e.g., a core or an elective course). Lab courses are designated as such in the course descriptions.</p>
<p><em><strong>IV. Advanced seminars: </strong></em>Each student must take one advanced seminar (0400-level course) in psychology.  Advanced seminars in psychology emphasize the synthesis and integration of theory; these may be taken during junior and/or senior years. </p>
<p><strong><em><em>V.</em></em></strong> <em><strong>Electives</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Finally, students must choose any three additional courses from the psychology curriculum, including winter term. In addition to regular content courses, PSYC 0350, PSYC 0500, PSYC 0700, or the PSYC 0701/0702/0703 sequence may be used to satisfy one of the elective requirements.</p>
<h2>Requirements for the Minor in Psychology</h2>
<p>To earn a minor in psychology students need to complete five psychology courses, including the following:</p>
<ul><li>PSYC 0105</li>
<li>Two foundation/core courses from among PSYC 0201, PSYC 0202, PSYC 0203 (or PSYC 0204), PSYC 0205, PSYC 0216 (or PSYC 0225), PSYC 0224, PSYC 0226 (formerly PSYC 0301), and PSYC 0227 (formerly PSYC 0305)</li>
<li>Two electives (any fall, spring, or winter term PSYC courses; one of which can be PSYC 0350, PSYC 0500, or PSYC 0700).</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>Research Opportunities:</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em><em>There are options for students who are interested in conducting research in psychology. </em>Students need permission from a faculty member prior to enrollment in these courses. <em> </em></p>
<ul><li><strong><em>Sophomores and Juniors</em> </strong>may take Directed Research (PSYC 0350) or Advanced Research (PSYC 0500) under the supervision of a faculty member.</li>
<li><strong><em>Seniors </em></strong>may choose to pursue Senior Research (PSYC 0700) or a Senior Thesis (PSYC 0701/0702/0703).  Senior Research and Senior Theses offer students the opportunity to further synthesize and integrate psychology theory and data by conducting research in collaboration with a faculty mentor.</li>
</ul><p>Students cannot take more than one psychology independent research course (PSYC 0350, PSYC 0500, or PSYC 0700) per semester.</p>
<h2>Departmental Honors in Psychology</h2>
<p>Students who meet the department requirements may apply to the department to complete a senior honors thesis in psychology.  A thesis requires students to apply their skills and knowledge to the completion of a year-long empirical research project. Students intending to complete honors work are expected to submit a <em>Thesis Intent Form</em> by the stated deadline (early to mid-March) of their junior year. Therefore, students should consult with a faculty member before that deadline to actively begin planning their research. The psychology thesis requires three semesters (including Winter Term) of independent research. During the fall term of their senior year, candidates will enroll in PSYC 0701. During the winter and spring terms, after meeting the special requirements listed in the course description and being accepted into honors candidacy, they will enroll in PSYC 0702 and PSYC 0703, respectively (adjustments to this schedule will be made for students entering in February). A minimum GPA of 3.5 in psychology department courses is required for admission to honors candidacy. <br>
 </p>
<h2>Advanced Placement</h2>
<p>Students can bypass PSYC 0105 and move directly to a higher-level course if they earned a Psychology AP Examination score of 4 or 5, or earned a score of 6 or 7 on the IB (International Baccalaureate) Higher Level psychology exam. Students who achieved a score of 4 or 5 on the Psychology AP Examination can also earn course credit for PSYC 105 (for Middlebury College’s policy on the use of AP credits, see: <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/academic/records/ap">http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/academic/records/ap</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Students who wish to use an AP or IB score to bypass PSYC 105 must submit their Psychology AP or IB score to Middlebury prior to enrolling in a course with PSYC 105 as a pre-requisite. </strong>Psychology Department faculty will not provide waivers for courses with PSYC 105 as a pre-requisite based upon an AP or IB score that has not been submitted to the College.</p>
<p>Beginning with students matriculating in the Fall of 2016, the department will not grant course credit for the Statistics AP Examination towards the major, the minor, or as an equivalent for PSYC 0201 (Psychological Statistics).</p>
<h2>Transfer Credits in Fulfillment of the Psychology Major and Minor</h2>
<p>Students may transfer no more than two psychology courses toward the major or minor while enrolled as a full time student at Middlebury. Students wishing to obtain approval to transfer more than two courses must petition the department in advance.</p>
<h2>Major in Neuroscience</h2>
<p>See the Neuroscience Program listing for a description of this major.</p>
<h2>Major in Environmental Studies with a focus in Psychology</h2>
<p>See the Environmental Studies Program listing for a description of this major.</p>
<h2>Education Studies Minor with a Psychology Major</h2>
<p>Up to two of the Psychology courses required for the Education Studies minor may also be counted towards the Psychology major.</p>

			<span class="course_description">Emotions inform thoughtful decisions, but also prompt knee-jerk reactions that make us appear irrational at times.  They inspire and dissuade us at both conscious and unconscious levels.  They evolved to trigger self-protective responses, but their dark side fuels self-destructive behaviors as well.  In this course we will discuss what emotions are, where they come from, how individual emotions differ, and whether or not everyone experiences emotions the same way.  We will also explore how appreciating the complexities of emotions might improve emotion regulation and interpersonal dynamics.  Topics to be considered will include biological, socio-cultural, clinical, and cognitive theories of emotion.

			<h3>PSYC 0220 Cultural Psychology (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Historically, much psychological research has focused on the United States and has aimed to interpret human psychological processes without reference to their cultural contexts. Cultural psychology, by contrast, holds that culture is essential for human psychology as we know it. The goal of this course is to understand that premise. Drawing on new research insights from around the globe, we will explore cross-cultural variations in psychological functioning from emotions, cognitions, and perceptions, to development, personality, and mental health. We will analyze where cultural variations come from, how the mind becomes enculturated, and the sense in which human nature is cultural.

To understand this complex disorder, addictions are studied from the basic neural mechanisms, such as how neurons respond to addictive substances, to psychological factors and how they protect or increase risk. In this course we will examine the principles of substance addictions, emerging behavioral addictions (internet/gaming, problem-gambling), and underlying mechanisms that drive addiction. Topics include neural pathways of addictive substances, brain functional and structural changes, theories of motivation, neuropsychological risk factors, and modern prevention and treatment. Psychology and neuroscience students will bring their relative expertise to the class for thoughtful review of the literature.(PSYC 0105; not open to first year students; open to psychology and neuroscience majors; others by waiver) 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>PSYC 0425 The Dynamic Brain (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">From its structural organization, to changes in neuronal connectivity associated with learning, to transient modulation associated with cognitive processes like attention and emotion, the brain relies on multiple processes to generate dynamic patterns of brain activity.  These brain activity patterns, in turn, form the basis for diverse brain functions and even our conscious experience.  In this course, through background lectures and class discussion of primary scientific literature, we will explore the underpinnings of dynamic brain activity and work towards developing an overall model of how the brain functions.

For better or worse, the gene variants we inherit from our parents contribute to our predispositions to psychological disorders, our personalities, and even the way in which we perceive the world around us. To be clear, anything that you can do or think is in some way influenced by your genes. However, this statement comes with a large caveat: except in the case of (relatively) rare single gene mutations, your genes do not determine but rather contribute to who you are. Working within the field of behavior genetics, we will cover topics such as social behavior, sexual promiscuity, drug abuse, language, intelligence, and psychopathology.

		<h1>Department of Religion</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>Requirements for the Major</h2>
<p>The Religion major allows students to concentrate in a variety of sub-fields within the larger field of the study of religion. These sub-fields can be based on traditions, geographical areas, or themes.</p>
<p>While the plausibility of concentrating in a given sub-field depends on the availability of expert faculty members therein, the department currently offers the following concentrations: </p>
<ul><li><strong>Traditions, </strong>such as Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism. </li>
<li><strong>Geographical areas</strong>, such as South Asia, East Asia, and the Americas.</li>
<li><strong>Themes</strong>, such as religion and politics, mysticism, ethics, and sacred texts.</li>
</ul><p>Students are encouraged to consult with faculty members to explore other options or combinations thereof.</p>
<h3>Eleven Courses</h3>
<p>The major will consist of at least <strong>eleven </strong>courses, including no more than one winter term course, distributed as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>A primary concentration of five </strong>courses<strong>: </strong>a four course concentration in a specific sub-field plus a <strong>senior </strong>project or thesis, RELI 0700, RELI 0701, related to that sub-field. The courses must include a <strong>0</strong><strong>100 </strong>level course and a <strong>0</strong><strong>300 </strong>level <strong>seminar </strong>that focus in that concentration.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>RELI 0400</strong>, Seminar on the Study of Religion</li>
</ul><ul><li>A <strong>distribution </strong>of <strong>five </strong>other courses elected by the student in close consultation with his/her adviser, subject to the following provisions:</li>
</ul><p>(1) Majors must make sure that they have had exposure to a variety of different religious <strong>traditions </strong>(for example, Asian and Western) as well as a variety of <strong>methodological </strong>approaches to the study of religion (for example, historical, sociological, anthropological, or philosophical).</p>
<p>(2) Majors must take at least one 0300 <strong>seminar outside </strong>their primary sub-field of concentration within the religion department.</p>
<p>(3) In the absence of a suitable 0100 level course in a given concentration, Reli0100 (Introduction to Religion) will satisfy this requirement.</p>
<p>(4) In unusual circumstances, and with the prior approval of the instructor and the chair of the department, certain 0200 level courses can count as a 0300 level seminar for the purpose of satisfying major requirements.</p>
<p><em>Important note</em>: Students should consult closely with faculty advisors to determine which courses in the department satisfy a given concentration. The chair of the department, in consultation with the student’s advisor, will determine how transfer credits and courses taken during study abroad will be applied toward departmental requirements.</p>
<h2>Joint Major</h2>
<p><em>Please note</em>: the chair of the department must approve each joint major proposal. For the Religion component of a joint major, a student will complete <strong>seven </strong>courses:</p>
<ul><li>A <strong>primary concentration </strong>of <strong>four </strong>courses in one sub-field plus a <strong>senior</strong> project or thesis related to that sub-field as well <strong>as the other major</strong>. These courses will include a 0100-level course and a 0300-level seminar that focus in that <strong>concentration</strong>.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>RELI 0400. </strong>Seminar on the Study of Religion</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><strong>Two elective</strong>s, chosen to ensure exposure to a variety of different religious <strong>traditions </strong>(for example, Asian and Western) as well as a variety of <strong>methodological </strong>approaches to the study of religion (for example, historical, sociological, anthropological or philosophical).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the student will complete a s<strong>enior p</strong>roject or thesis, RELI 0700, RELI 0701, utilizing the expertise of both majors.</p>
<h2>Religion Minor</h2>
<p>The Religion minor will consist of at least <strong>five </strong>courses, <strong>three </strong>of which will focus in a single <strong>concentration</strong>. One of the courses in the focus must be a <strong>seminar </strong>at the 0300-level or above.</p>
<h2>The Minor in Jewish Studies</h2>
<p>Refer to <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/jewish">Jewish Studies</a> for description.</p>
<h2>The Minor in Hebrew</h2>
<p>Refer to <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/hebrew">Hebrew</a> for description<em><strong>.</strong></em></p>
<h2>Departmental Honors</h2>
<p>Graduation with departmental honors requires at least a B+ in courses counted toward the major. Students who meet this threshold and receive an A- or A on their senior project will be awarded Honors. Students who meet the course grade threshold and write a thesis will be eligible for Honors if the thesis grade is at least a B+, and High Honors if the thesis grade is an A- or A. Highest Honors will be reserved for students who earn at least an A- in courses counted toward the major and an A on the thesis. </p>

			<h3>RELI 0210 Mindfulness: Buddhism and Science (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this course we will be examining the practice of mindfulness. Students will learn about traditional Buddhist meditation, how to analyze original sources in translation, and to assess ways that religious traditions are transformed in the modern era. We will look at the origins and aims of mindfulness in traditional Asian Buddhism, see how it came to the West, and examine the processes of secularization and psychologization that led to its popularization. We will read Buddhist primary sources in translation, trace its history from colonial Myanmar through India to the contemporary West, examine its development in the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program, and its proliferation in various institutions within the United States. We will read scientific studies examining its psychological benefits and watch some films about it.

			<h3>RELI 0221 Early Daoist Texts (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The two great early Daoist (Taoist) texts, the <em>Daodejing (Tao te ching)</em> and the <em>Zhuangzi (Chuang–tzu)/, date from the Warring States period (475 -221 BCE) of China and remain widely read and studied. We will read them closely and slowly, considering questions of authorship, audience, philosophical and religious content, and translation. We will wrestle at length with these wonderful and difficult texts, with attention primarily to their original context and secondarily to their reception and interpretation in later religion, philosophy, and literature in East Asia and beyond.

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will explore how narrative art articulates spiritual perception by examining selected works of 20th century writers such as Miguel De Unamuno, Nikos Kazantzakis, J. D. Salinger, Charles Williams, Flannery O'Connor, Thomas Merton, Alice Munroe, Marilynne Robinson, and Annie Dillard.  Drawing on theology and philosophy as an interpretative mode, we will consider the following questions: How does literature illuminate selfhood and interiority? How do contemplation and ascetic practice guide the self to divine knowledge and cosmic unification? How do language, imagery and symbols shape the unitive experience as a tool for empathy and understanding of the other? 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will study the great medieval classic <em>The Arabian Nights</em> or <em>The Thousand and One Nights Entertainment</em>. Compiled in Egypt and Syria in the 14th century and translated into French and other European languages in the 17th and 18th centuries, this “ocean story” has had a profound effect on the development of the literatures of both the Middle East and the West.

Drawing on literary sources (e.g. Homer, Hesiod, tragedy, and comedy, among others) and archaeological evidence, we will study the Greek views of the gods as these emerge from both mythical narratives and cult practice. We will explore the Greek ideas of personal salvation, but also the importance of religious festivals for the community of the polis. Finally, while looking at ancient philosophical critiques of the traditional gods, we will trace the transition to Christianity and we will compare the sacred in Greek culture with the place of religion in our own society.  3 hrs. lect., 1 hr. disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Emphasis will be on in depth and slow reading of the texts and understanding how and why they have come to be held at such high esteem by relevant Muslim communities. Through our discussions about these texts, we will try to re-examine the dominant notions of what constitutes a “religion,” particularly what constitutes “Islam.” Readings will include selections from the Qur’an and the biography of Prophet Muhammad, sayings/biography of Muslim saints and mystical poetry, theological and philosophical treatises, and more.

			<h3>RELI 0264 Jews and Christians: Conflict and Identity (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">“Urging a Jew to convert to Christianity is like advising a person to move upstairs while demolishing the ground floor.” This quip by Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786) epitomizes Christianity’s conflicted attitude to its Jewish origin, affirming it while rejecting it. Yet the relationship is not symmetrical, for the very reason that Judaism precedes Christianity. In this course we examine the fraught relationship between Christians and Jews from antiquity to the present. Readings include Church Fathers, rabbinic texts, polemics, theologians, as well as the Catholic declarations of Vatican II and modern interfaith dialogue. 3 hrs. lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>RELI 0273 Religion and Capitalism (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Joseph Schumpeter described capitalism as animated by a perennial gale of creative destruction. While he was referring to its capacity to create and destroy industries, capitalism has had the same effect on social worlds. From those tumultuous worlds, a diverse array of religious practices, beliefs, and sentiments have likewise flourished and decayed. This course explores the relationship between global capitalism and religion in the modern period. Anchored in a comparison between Brazil and the United States, we will explore how religious traditions have encountered the world transformed by capitalism as well as the religious dimensions of capitalism itself. 3 hours lect./disc.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>RELI 0275 Religion and Politics in Iran (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The Islamic revolution of 1979, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, propelled Iran to the position of the arch-nemesis of the United States in the region. As a result of hostile media coverage, there are many misconceptions that pervade our understanding of post-revolutionary Iran. In this course we will try to offer a more nuanced understanding by looking deeper into the history of Iran beginning from the era of the early Islamic conquests. A focus of the course will be examining the intersection of religion and politics in the early modern, modern, and finally, contemporary Iranian society.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">What does the Bible say about sex, marriage, and homosexuality? While many people claim “the” biblical perspective on this question, the Bible offers various–often complicated–stories and teachings about gender and sexuality. In this course, we will closely read key biblical passages concerning God’s gender, marriage and divorce, family life, sexual violence, women’s social status, asceticism, and sexual orientation. Special attention will be paid to the ancient Mediterranean sociocultural milieu within which ancient Israelites and early Christians constructed their ideas and practices about sex and gender. We will ultimately ask: how might our nuanced understanding of gender and sexuality in the Bible inform contemporary debates on sexual difference, gender inequality, and sexuality and social leadership? 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">Who was Jesus of Nazareth? How does the historical Jesus differ from Jesus Christ in the Gospels? In this course we will explore how early Christians remembered Jesus and developed traditions about him. We will read both canonical (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) and non-canonical (e.g., Thomas, Mary, Peter) Gospels within their historical and literary contexts, focusing on Judaism, the Roman Empire, and Greco–Roman cultures. We will then examine the critical approaches modern scholars take to reconstruct the historical Jesus’ life. By comparing diverse portraits of Jesus both in ancient literature and in modern scholarship, we will evaluate such diversity’s implications for our intellectual and cultural life today.

We shall trace the transition from the mystery religions of Demeter and Isis in the Eastern Mediterranean to the cult of Mary the Mother of God (Theotokos) and the worship of female saints.  Drawing on a wide range of sources (hymns, saints' Lives, Apocryphal Gospels, Patristic texts, and icons), we shall study the varieties of female devotion and examine the roles available to women in the early Church: deaconesses and desert mothers, monastics and martyrs, poets and rulers.  Different theoretical approaches will enable us to ask a series of questions: were women in the early Church considered capable of holiness? To what extent did the female 'gifts of the spirit' challenge church authority?  What is distinct about the feminine experience of the divine?  Finally, we shall consider the vision and poetics of female spirituality in select modern poets.  3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

CE), one of two major schools of Indian Buddhism, in relation to cognitive science and philosophy of mind. We will examine these ideas historically, philosophically and comparatively. We focus on the Yogacara analyses of the largely unconscious ‘construction of reality’ and its systematic deconstruction through forms of analytic meditation. We will read primary and secondary texts on Indian Buddhism and texts espousing similar ideas in modern philosophy and the social and cognitive sciences.

Through primary and secondary source analysis (including textual, visual and aural sources), we will explore the challenges and opportunities this multi-confessional reality posed to Russia’s rulers and the official Orthodox Church. We will also probe the question of what religious faith (in its multiple iterations) meant for subjects from across the social strata and geographic expanse of the empire. How did one lead a spiritually fulfilled life? How did members of different religious faiths interact? What was the relationship between religious and ethnic identities? 3 hrs sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

After exploring Christianity’s role in the historical development of western liberal arts, we will ask what place, if any, theological study has in modern secular liberal arts education. Reading primarily modern theologians, we will ask what intellectual value theological study holds for people who do not identify with Christianity. We will consider the impact of critical thinking, cultivated by the liberal arts, on adherents’ examination of their theological tradition. And we will examine the relationship between theological studies and other intellectual disciplines, including other approaches to the academic study of religion.

			<span class="course_description">In this seminar, we will start our adventure in the Sufi world by focusing on the historical and religious contexts in which the mystical tradition of Islam developed during the early Islamic centuries. We will then turn to the so-called classical period focusing on the institutionalization of Sufism, major themes of the classical Sufi literature; fundamental teachings and practices of Sufis; and important figures like Rumi, Ibn Arabi, and Hafez. Finally, we will move to the modern period to discuss the ways in which the Sufi tradition has been re-interpreted, contested, or transformed  throughout the Muslim world in response to the challenges of modernity. In all this, our main concern will be to develop an understanding of the mystical perspective that has influenced the outlook of much of the world's diverse Muslim population.

Yet, the question of how we as global citizens should read the Bible gives rise to the challenge of considering contested views on minorities in history. In this course we will investigate ways in which the Bible portrays women, children, slaves, foreigners, and people with disabilities, using feminist and minoritized hermeneutics. Asking how these portrayals have been interpreted in modern religio–political contexts, we will reflect upon the impact of biblical interpretation on the lives of others.

This myth portrays the success of rock as having supernatural origins, while obscuring how the recording industry appropriated and commodified the art of Black Americans. In this seminar we explore the polysemous image of the “crossroads” as an entrée into the intersecting fields of  comparative religion, humanistic economics, and critical race. We will rely on works by authors such as Gloria Anzaldúa and Toni Morrison to interrogate these fields while comparing the histories of the U.S. and Brazil. 3 hrs. sem</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>RELI 0400 Methods in the Study of Religion (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">How do we think about religion? Is there a common way to talk about religion across cultural divides or should we simply concur that religion is like art, where “We can’t define it, but we know it when we see it? This course will take us through the basic twentieth and twenty-first century theories in the study of religion as “ways of perceiving” this most elusive of phenomena: anthropology, psychology, history, text, politics, philosophy, theology, experience. All of these ways of perceiving religion play a crucial role in the history of the field. We will end by thinking through recent issues in the study of religion–religion and politics, gender and sexuality, comparative and interfaith studies, and the authority of religious identity. Students will be asked to outline a single, compelling case study in religion, and each week they will apply the theorists we read to the details of their case.  In applying theories about religion to real-life situations, students will become skillful practitioners of the art of interpreting religion. They will also develop their own approaches to the study of religion and be able to articulate that approach to a wider audience. (At least 3 courses in the study of religion or by waiver.

		<h1>Department of Russian</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>Major Requirements</h2>
<p>Normally, majors must complete second-year Russian, RUSS 0122, RUSS 0151, four other courses, including at least one mainstream course in Russia, and a senior seminar (HIST 0247 and HIST 0248 may be substituted for RUSS 0122). </p>
<p>Each student’s program is planned individually with the department chair. Students planning careers in government, business, or law are advised to consider a major in the Russian and East European studies track of the International and Global Studies program. </p>
<p>Russian majors also frequently combine their language study with a minor in economics, geography, history, or political science, or do a joint or double major with one of these subjects. Majors planning teaching careers should study a second language, preferably through at least the third-year level, and should consult members of the education studies faculty regarding certification.</p>
<h2>Minor Requirements </h2>
<p>The Russian department offers two minor programs: </p>
<p><strong>The Russian language minor (RULN) </strong>includes RUSS 0101, RUSS 0103, RUSS 0201, RUSS 0202, RUSS 0311 and RUSS 0312.</p>
<p><strong>The Russian literature and culture minor (RULC)</strong> includes any two of RUSS 0122, RUSS 0151, RUSS 0152, and three additional content courses in the Russian department (RUSS/FMMC0245, RUSS0217, RUSS0241, RUSS 0351, RUSS 0352, RUSS 0354, RUSS 0355, and RUSS/ENAM 0359, or other appropriate courses pending approval of the chair). A first-year seminar may, on occasion, be substituted for one of these courses.     </p>
<h2>Departmental Honors</h2>
<p>Majors with a B+ average in Russian courses and a B average overall are encouraged to prepare an honors thesis, the final copy of which is due April 20 of the year of graduation. Departmental honors are determined by a combination of thesis grade and grade point average in courses taken in the Russian Department, the Russian School and Middlebury’s programs in Russia. Highest honors will be awarded for a GPA of 3.75 plus A on the thesis; high honors will be awarded for a GPA of 3.5 and A- or better on the thesis, and honors will be awarded for a GPA of 3.35 and a grade of B+ or better on the thesis.</p>
<h2>Junior Year in Russia</h2>
<p>All majors and language minors are encouraged to study for a year in Russia. Middlebury’s programs at Irkutsk State University, Russian State University for the Humanities in Moscow, and Yaroslavl State Pedagogical University are open to juniors who have completed 0300-level Russian. Students in Moscow may also enroll in courses at the Shchukin Theater Institute and the Higher School of Economics. Students are strongly encouraged to spend a summer in the Kathryn Wasserman Davis School of Russian on the Middlebury College campus before studying abroad in Russia. Students who have completed only 0200-level Russian must spend the fall semester at Yaroslavl. In their first semester, all students will take conversation, composition, and culture/civilization courses organized exclusively for our students; students who have completed third-year-level Russian will also take one mainstream course with Russian students, selected from the full university curriculum. In the second semester, students who have not yet taken a mainstream course will take one, and students who have already taken one will take two or more, in addition to the courses organized for Middlebury. Majors are expected to take at least one mainstream course while in Russia. Students unable to attend for a full year may study in Russia for one semester, preferably in the fall. The following courses are among those offered at our programs in Russia in recent years. While we cannot guarantee that each of these courses will be available on a regular basis, they are representative of the kinds of offerings students may expect:</p>

			<span class="course_description">Duels, ghosts, utopias, murders, prostitution, and adultery- these are the raw materials Russian authors turned into some of the world's greatest literature. This course is an introduction to Russian literature of the 19th century, from the short stories of Pushkin and Gogol to the great novels of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. The centrality of literature in Russian society and the interrelations among the authors and texts will be discussed. How do the authors combine reality, fantasy, and philosophy to make these works both uniquely Russian and universal? 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>RUSS 0241 Putinism and Contemporary Russian Culture (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union was hailed in the West as a triumph of democracy over totalitarianism; for some observers the event even signaled “the end of history.” Today however it seems history is “back,” with Russia under Putin once again assuming its former role as enemy and the “other” of the West. In this course we will seek a better understanding of this apparent reversal of vectors from <em>within</em> Russian culture, while situating it within larger illiberal trends in world politics, by analyzing literary works, popular cinema, political theory, journalism, social media, and other forms of cultural production. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

		<h1>Department of Sociology</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><h2>Required for the Major</h2>
<p>A minimum of 10 courses will constitute the major. All sociology majors will complete SOCI 0105, SOCI 0301, SOCI 0305, and a 400-level seminar. In addition, majors will take six electives, with at least two at the 300 level. At least eight of these courses (and all of the core courses listed) must be fall and spring courses taught at Middlebury (e.g., not winter term courses or transfer credits).</p>
<h2>Required for a Joint Major</h2>
<p>A joint major consists of seven courses: SOCI 0105, SOCI 0301, SOCI 0305, a 400-level senior seminar in sociology, and three electives. No more than one elective may be taken outside of the regular fall and spring semesters at Middlebury (e.g., as a winter term course or transfer credit). Any departures from this program must be approved by the department chair.</p>
<h2>Required for a Minor</h2>
<p>The minor consists of five courses: SOCI 0105 and four electives. All courses must be taken at Middlebury (e.g., no transfer credits or internships), with no more than one winter term course.</p>
<h2>Optional Senior Project in Sociology</h2>
<p>To be eligible for departmental honors, students must complete an independent research project of at least one semester. This typically consists of either a one-semester senior project (SOCI 0700, one credit, usually 25–40 pages) or a two-semester senior project (SOCI 0710, two credits, usually 60–100 pages). Students who wish to work on a project for more than one semester must present their progress for review by two professors who will decide whether the project qualifies for extended study. A one-semester project can be either in the fall or spring semester; a two-semester project is usually in the fall and winter semesters or in the winter and spring semesters. Variation from these patterns is possible with permission from the department. Senior project requirements for joint majors and other special circumstances will be approved in consultation with both departments.</p>
<p>A SOCI 0700 project requires a project advisor. If the advisor thinks that the project may deserve an A– or A, a second reader must evaluate the project. A SOCI 0710 project requires a committee including the project advisor and a second reader from within the Sociology Department. It may also include an optional third reader from another part of the College or the local community. Upon completion of the SOCI 0710 project, there will be an oral defense.</p>
<h2>Departmental Honors</h2>
<p>Students who earn an A– or higher on a 0700 or 0710 project and average an A– or higher in all sociology courses receive departmental honors.</p>
<p>Current majors and minors who declared under the present system would continue to operate under this system. They would, however, have the option of choosing to shift to the new set of requirements and degrees if their current situation allows for it. Once the new departments are formed, all future majors and minors would operate under the new sets of requirements.</p>
<h2>Joint Major in Anthropology and Sociology</h2>
<p>The joint major in anthropology and sociology consists of 12 classes. The core courses are ANTH 103, SOCI 105, SOCI 301 or ANTH 302 or ANTH 396, and SOC 305 or ANTH 306. Students must also take one 400-level SOCI course, one 400-level ANTH course, and six electives. A 700-level course in ANTH or SOCI can replace one of the 400-level courses.</p>

			<span class="course_description">What is your gender and how do you know? In order to answer this question, we need to consider how gender is known through biology, psychology, consumer capitalism, and our everyday embodiment.  We will also look at how the meaning and performance of gender have changed over time from Classical Greece to Victorian England to the contemporary U.S.  Throughout, we will consider how gender does not operate along, but is always entangled with, race, class, sexuality, nationality, and ability.

We will also critically analyze various topics, including violence, cheating, and technology while focusing on “mega sporting events,” the media, and eSport. Additionally, by using sport as a lens to examine class, gender, and race we will illuminate the manners in which sport is entangled in socio-cultural, political, and economic forces. <strong>This course is part of the Public Humanities Labs Initiative administered by the Axinn Center for the Humanities.</strong> (formerly SOAN 0218) 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

After tracing the origins of the ethnic categories of “Ashkenazi” (Western) and Mizrachi (Middle Eastern/North African) Jews, we examine the history of immigration to Israel in the 1950s, considering how ethnicity came to define class and geography. In subsequent units, we will deal with Mizrachi protest movements such as the Israeli 1970s “Black Panthers” and the more recent trend of Mizrachi intellectuals to reclaim the “Arab-Jew” identity, and in comparison, the Mizrachi traditional support of hawkish positions regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the concluding units, we will utilize comparative tools to conceptualize this internal Jewish dynamic.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

We will discuss two distinct issues that are often conflated in public discussions: economic inequality and social mobility.  We will consider the conceptual and empirical associations between these measures, how each has changed over time, how the United States compares to other countries, and how different social environments (such as colleges, neighborhoods, and families) influence life chances within and across generations. We will also examine the challenges of producing research about these topics, focusing on both theoretical and methodological issues.

Drawing on theories and empirical research from sociology and related fields, we will analyze the logic of antisemitic narratives, how antisemitism differs from other forms of racism, how antisemitism has changed after the Holocaust, whether antisemitism and anti-Zionism are related phenomena, and how prevalent antisemitic attitudes and discrimination remain today. We will also explore what role antisemitism plays in contemporary conspiracy theories and far-right movements but also whether there are forms of antisemitism specific to the Left. Overall, we will consider how to integrate an analysis of antisemitism into contemporary theories of racism, such as Intersectionality or Critical Whiteness. 3 hrs. lect.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

We will consider drugs and addiction as <em>ideas</em> that reflect concerns about the “self” in modernity. We will examine the panic surrounding drug use and addiction, our preoccupation with treatment, and our emphasis on sobriety.  Overall, we will engage with the larger themes the idea of drugs and addiction raises: harm, exclusion, inequality, pleasure, freedom, desire, perfection, enlightenment, and control. 3hrs. lect./disc.

			<h3>SOCI 0485 Topics in Sociological Practice (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this project-based course, we will use tools of data analysis and digital methods to explore sociological research topics and communicate findings. We will review examples of public social science such as the Opportunity Atlas, Social Explorer, and the Open Policing Project. Through readings and workshops, we will reflect on how these forms create challenges and opportunities related to data ethics, principles of data visualization, and digital pedagogy. Students will build on their previous coursework to develop interactive websites that can be integrated throughout the department's curricula. Students will extensively use programs such as R and Datawrapper but no previous experience with these tools is required. (Open to Sociology majors) (SOCI 0105) 3 hrs. sem.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ART 0155 Figuratively Distorted: Creating Characters for Cartoon, Caricature, and Animation (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">In this introductory class we will explore the human figure and its mannerisms through learning to draw using methods that invent expressive characters. We will learn foundational drawing principles depicting the figure from observation, studying its anatomy and how that manifests human expression. We will see, learn, and use the principles of drawing found in images of humans in the Lascaux Caves and Mayan Reliefs; to expressionists like Egon Schiele; and cartoons from Walt Disney to South Park. Students will develop their own individual cartoon characters and storyboard an archetypical narrative forming a collaborative class animation screened publicly in Twilight. No prior drawing experience is expected. It is a 100 level beginning level class open to and designed for students with no visual artmaking experience. This course will count as a prerequisite towards 300-level courses in The Program In Studio Art. 6 hrs lct.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>ART 0156 Drawing: Unlearning What You See (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Drawing is an intuitive act of expression. It serves many purposes: observation, emotional reflection, and creating altered realities beyond the written word. In this course we will learn foundational drawing techniques utilizing different approaches and materials including dry and wet media and basic sculptural principles to understand volume depicting space and figures. We address composition, scale, contour delineation, and tonal values. Developing a personal style will be paramount.

			<h3>ART 0169 Topics in Contemporary Art (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">The term "contemporary art" names not only artworks made over the past half-century, but the art-historical discourse that attempts to explain them, the network of museums and exhibition spaces through which they reach the public, and the global industry in which they are bought and sold. In this course we will examine contemporary art’s relationship to the political, social, and technological developments of our era, attempting to answer the questions: How do we make sense of art produced in the present day? And: How does this art help us understand the world?</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will investigate physical structures encountered daily. Buildings, parks, and infrastructure constitute this built environment, reflecting their societies. But what could abolitionist architecture look like, or how might public space in the U.S. create new social relations? Through lenses of race, class, and gender we will build critical vocabularies around the practice of making space. We will focus on the historical and contemporary embodiment of power, race, and culture of the U.S. through the built environment. This studio class will then present a series of projects addressing basic three-dimensional construction and model making techniques. We will engage historical and contemporary artworks, urban planning, architecture, and poetry from perspectives of resistance to dominant modes of constructing space.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<span class="course_description">In this course we will examine monuments, memorials, landscape, and cultural memory. The title comes from a 1979 sculptural work by the black feminist artist Beverly Buchanan. Buchanan has described her works as monuments made from earthen materials to remember acts of black resistance in the United States. We will also investigate recent actions to remove and destroy monuments to confederate soldiers and other figures related to colonial violence. This is a studio class incorporating material experimentation and research. Students will work at model scale using paper, wood, plaster, digital photography, and photoshop to propose (anti)monuments for our time.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

			<h3>THEA 0230 The Plays of Station Eleven (Spring 2023)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">This course will provide a study of theatrical literature through an interrogation of the specific ways live performance and the human body inform meaning in text-based theatre. We will begin with a reading of the novel <em>Station Eleven</em> by Emily St. John Mandel, the plot of which centers around a traveling troupe of actors performing plays after a plague. After studying the novel and subsequent television series, we will begin a deep reading of the plays depicted within the story, including Shakespeare’s <em>King Lear</em> and <em>Hamlet</em>. Following these tragedies, we will read modern plays that explore different forms, themes, styles, and methods of theatre-making, again led by the evocations of post-pandemic performance. Contemporary plays will include Jonathan Payne’s <em>The Revolving Cycles Truly and Steadily Roll’d</em>, Tom Stoppard’s <em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</em>, Liz Duffy Adams’ <em>Dog Act</em>, Anne Washburn’s <em>Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play</em>, Caridad Svich’s <em>Twelve Ophelias</em>, and Sarah Ruhl’s <em>Passion Play</em>.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Amira Baraka, Adrienne Kennedy, August Wilson, and Brandon Jacobs-Jenkins. We will also engage with theoretical essays by Alain Locke, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Patricia Hill Collins and more, that illuminate how, despite centuries of lethal stereotyping, the stage has been and continues to be a forum for self-representation, unification, resistance, and liberation. Guest artists will provide firsthand accounts in conversation with the students. Dramaturgical and critical responses to the materials will strengthen production interpretation and design skills.</span>			<span class="course_requirements">

		<h1>Writing and Rhetoric Program</h1>
		<article class="requirements"><p>The <strong>first</strong> writing intensive course is the f<a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/first-year-seminar">irst-year seminar</a>, taught by faculty across the disciplines.</p>
<p>The <strong>second</strong> writing intensive course is generally taken by the end of a student’s sophomore year or as determined by their major area of study. This course is designated by a “CW.”  </p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The second-level CW course features in-class discussion of writing and attention to revision. College writing courses are limited in size, and faculty are asked to provide written responses to drafts and to meet individually with students to discuss their work. Peer review, or a writing workshop, is also recommended for college writing courses.</p>
<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>Expectations for writing in the second-level CW course vary from department to department and class to class. Some classes require 20 pages of polished prose. Other courses might not think in terms of page numbers. Such courses include, but are not limited to, those that teach digital writing or writing with charts and graphs, or those that highlight short writing forms.</p>
<h2>Information for Class Instructors</h2>
<p><strong>Instructors are encouraged to assign informal writing as well as formal writing.</strong> Informal writing, often known as “writing to learn,” might be graded or ungraded and might include journals, field notes, informal responses to readings, online discussions, and in-class writing. Informal writing can build student confidence and generate class discussion as well as be developed into formal writing projects. </p>
<p><strong>Formal writing assignments are often graded,</strong> but other faculty prefer the effects of “ungrading” until the end of the semester. Either way, faculty are encouraged to provide ample qualitative feedback on formal work. Formal writing projects can include critical and/or creative writing. Genres for formal projects include argumentative essays, research papers, critical narratives, literature reviews, case studies, op-eds, blogs, digital stories, videos, podcasts, short fiction or poems based on theory or research, etc.</p>
<p><strong>In some departments, College writing classes are highly disciplinary</strong> and are only open to students majoring in the department or program. In other departments, the CW class is open to students across the College, and course content may vary widely.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty seeking approval of their CW class should contact Catharine Wright, director of the Writing and Rhetoric Program.</strong> In addition, faculty may contact any member of the Writing and Rhetoric Program to discuss their goals for their CW class and to obtain feedback on writing assignments, syllabus design, the peer review process, responding to student writing, and evaluating work. Members of the Writing and Rhetoric Program are also available to visit classes to talk about writing.</p>

			<h3>WRPR 0100 Writing and Power (Fall 2022)</h3> 
			<span class="course_description">Power: who has it, who doesn’t, and what does it have to do with your writing? This course both instructs students in how to access power in academic contexts and to critique power structures.
