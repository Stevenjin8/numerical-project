	annotate = {This is the original source from which FOR method came published in a professional scientific journal for mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences.  The author, Lewis Fry Richardson, was a mathematician and meteorologist interested in numerical weather forecasting.  In this article, the author presents a numerical approach to solving some common and important differential equations.  The method involves applying central finite differences so that the continuous differential equation is thereby replaced with a linear system of equations approximating the differential operator at a finite set of points.  In Section 3.2, the author proposes a method of successive approximations that will converge to the true solution of the linear system.  In later sources, this method is referred to as First-Order-Richardson.  This article includes an analysis of this method and sample calculations.  However, since this article predates computers and the development of modern linear algebra, the notation does not use current matrix-vector notation or methods of analysis. \\ \textbf{Annotation by:} M.
