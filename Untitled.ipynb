Together we will explore classic works of literature such as Alcott’s <em>Little Women</em>, Twain’s <em>Huck Finn</em>, and Morrison’s <em>The Bluest Eye</em>, in conversation with historical documents and visual and material artifacts (illustrations, painting, toys, and films).

Origin stories might be foundational, but their meanings are never fixed. In this course we will explore the elasticity and persistence of origin stories, evident in current debates about whether U.S. history begins in 1619 or 1776, about migrant rights, about the self-determination of indigenous peoples, about white nationalism, and about U.S. global leadership. 3 hrs. lect./disc. <strong>This course is part of the Public Humanities Labs Initiative administered by the Axinn Center for the Humanities.*</strong>\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"course_AMST0109\\\"},{\\\"description\\\":\\\"In this course we will trace American immigration history from the late 19th to the turn of the 21st century, and examine the essential place immigration has occupied in the making of modern America and American culture.

We will consider how and why America chooses to memorialize certain people and events, and what is gained—and sometimes erased—in the process.  By choosing among a broad range of traditional and non-traditional modes of representation, we will consider how public memorials both reflect and shape Americans’ shared cultural values.

What frameworks might maximize social impact in addressing such complicated global concerns?  In this capstone course for students interested in privilege and poverty, global health, and food studies, we will critically examine a variety of frameworks for social impact, including solidarity, responsibility, development, aid, and entrepreneurship. Our examination of these frameworks will necessarily involve critical comparisons among the countries in which they have been employed. We will identify goals, strategies, and assumptions within each framework, as well as our role in social transformation in conjunction with other actors. Students will engage in interdisciplinary theoretical analysis and employ one or more frameworks to develop a proposal for a project on social change.  (By approval only.) 3 hrs.

They represent different facets of the larger issue and discourse of security in the Middle East.<br><br>\\\\nThe seminar will address the issue and the discourse of security in the Middle East, with stress on the two sides of the spectrum, from weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to acts of terrorism. We will look at the issue of security from both the national and the regional levels.<br><br>\\\\nThe seminar’s fundamental starting point is that to understand the issue of security in the region one must examine the broader historical fundamentals of the region. Religion, ethnicity, ideology, identity and, of course, politics are all closely related to the broader issue of security. Those issues are at the core of all regional conflicts as well as global terrorism; those issues shape the making of the modern Middle East. For this reason the seminar begins with a broad introduction on the making of the modern Middle East. Among the basic themes to be discussed in that introduction are:<br><br>\\\\n the idea of the “Middle East” as a distinct geo-political region;<br>\\\\n the fundamentals of the region: the religious, ethnic, and linguistic composition of the Middle East;<br>\\\\nThe split Sunni versus Shia<br>\\\\nIslam as the major religion of the Middle East;<br>\\\\nthe collapse of the Ottoman Empire as the cradle of the modern Middle East;<br>\\\\nthe formation of the state system in the Middle East;<br>\\\\nthe rise of political Zionism,<br>\\\\nthe birth of the Arab-Israeli conflict;<br>\\\\nthe rise of modern Iran;<br>\\\\n the creation of Modern Saudi Arabia and the Gulf;<br><br>\\\\nThen, and against this introductory background, the seminar will examine the issue of contemporary security in the Middle East from both national and regional perspectives.

Students will preferably have prior experience in discussing issues of race and class, although introductory theories will be made available to provide frameworks for discussion.\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"course_WRPR0288\\\"},{\\\"description\\\":\\\"In this course students will explore the rhetorical performances of documentary film—in terms of production, ethics, and editing—and how documentaries are used for different means: investigation, activism, and even propaganda. After watching contemporary documentaries and reading reviews, interviews, analyses, and theories of filmmaking, students will analyze specific films (with cultural rhetorics and social consciousness lenses), conduct and transcribe interviews, and write a code of ethics for documentary filmmakers.

Readings will address current issues in popular culture – Gladwell, “Brain Candy,” Klosterman, “Campus Confidential,” for instance. <em>ReMix: Reading in Contemporary Culture</em> is the central text.

       "{'description': 'In this course we will offer an introduction to the interdisciplinary study of American culture and identity. Integrating a range of sources and methods, we will examine myths, symbols, values, and social changes that have been used to create and contest ideas of \"Americanness.\" This year we will focus on holidays, both secular and religious, and how they have been celebrated or observed in the U.S., past and present, privately and publicly. With a multifaith and multiethnic scope, we will consider holidays such as Easter, Purim, Passover, Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr, Yom Kippur, and Diwali, as well as largely-secular holidays such as Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, Halloween, and Thanksgiving. We will also compare and contrast a variety of New Year festivities as they are celebrated by immigrant and diasporic communities. Sources for the course will include greeting cards, advertisements, magazine illustrations, decorations, cookbooks and recipes, genre paintings, music, photographic documentation of parades and festivals, and objects related to the celebration and observation of religious holidays from a variety of faiths and traditions. 3 hrs.',\n",
